Why we have written the lead with such a long parenthetical escapes me; that just cries out for copyediting. So does the whole article, but... I think the claim is accurately footnoted. The first sentence of the next section says he did his graduate studies in Scotland, and is cited to a pair of books. The Worldnetdaily article used in our article says the studies in Scotland were interrupted by the return to Kenya - but it could be interrupted after a masters and before a doctorate or it could be before either, impossible to tell. Frankly, I think if we just clean up the parenthetical comment, the sourcing will become clearer, and the material to my eyes generally satisfies WP:SELFPUB, but I'm not certain it passes the relevance part of the test. I've reviewed a bunch of our articles on prominent religious leaders, including both those widely respected (the current Pope, Billy Graham) and those best known for scandals (Bakker, Roberts) and none mentioned a degree in the introduction. Some don't mention degrees at all, some mention them in a subsection about early life or education. This fits with my general knowledge of the religious field; degrees are not of great importance to a minister. They may or may not equip him or her for the work, but they are mostly irrelevant to their current and potential congregants.",

I like to think we did adequate fact-checking, and we were tasked by the FAA to do adequate fact-checking. However, the particular document I authored was the opinion of my employer, presented to the task force.

Is someone trying to say that these idiots went to school and killed innocent children etc. because they didn't like the fact that they liked to have sex with or were attracted to other guys. How does that make any sense? Of course... nothing they did made sense but if they did go to school and kill people for this reason wouldn't they have stated that in their journals or something.

Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article, and should be appropriate to the claims made. Articles should be based on reliable, third-party, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Proper sourcing always depends on context; common sense and editorial judgment are an indispensable part of the process. Partisan secondary sources should be viewed with suspicion if they lack neutral corroboration. Widespread citation without comment for facts is evidence of a source's reputation and reliability for similar facts, while widespread doubts about reliability weigh against it. No other Brazilian newspaper, which are very close to the accident, use the expression \"\"dissenting report\"\" or highlight the \"\"conflict\"\". WP adds: The goal is to reflect established views of sources as far as we can determine them.

I can understand objecting to something ridiculous, like n****r trash, but that's only because the descriptive word is racist. White is not racist. Black is not racist. White trash is not racist. Racism implies superiority of one race over another. I surely don't think \"\"white trash\"\" implies all whites are trash. It'd be like if \"\"Chinese jerk\"\" were a term - no, it does not imply \"\"Chinese people are jerks,\"\" just that the particular person it is directed at is Chinese, and a jerk. Secondly, does it matter to the article? Is there a section saying it's racist, or do you want to add one?

My quarrel stopped when you added the references, although I would like to see your contribution the debate on talk:Forza Italia * Vlaams Belang: again the sourcing of the VB ideology is crucial, because it is so contested. I disagree with the characterization of VB as national conservative. Furthermore you seem to imply that national conservatism is somehow more extreme than liberal conservatism or conservatism without adjectives. I don't see this in the definitions on wiki or in Mair. * EFA: I think the huge list of non-member parties in the EFA is getting a tad ridiculous, adding what I thought were branches to the list was unnecessary IMO, but if they were existing parties before, inclusion is warranted.
