" Alright, I am willing to concede that the CIA allegations are flimsy at best, therefore, I will stop the edit warring. While you may not consider it too important, I think the issue of Assange as the founder to be another example of lazy journalism. Your source for Assange as founder of Wikleaks was MSNBC.com. I don't necessarily consider MSNBC to be a reliable source most of the time. Corporate news does not do ""real"" journalism. They copy news from one source or they make stories up. It seems to me that the idea of Assange as founder is a meme. I have never read a quote from Assange whereby he states that he founded Wikileaks. This idea seems to be mostly promulgated by the U.S. corporate media. Perhaps to vilify him in the minds of Americans, so that later he can be lynched. This seems like Propaganda 101 to me. The Wikileaks site does not identify Assange as the founder. Where is the evidence? THC Loadee 04:08, 4 MARCH 2011 (UTC)"

The Reference Desk is probably the place you want Hello! welcome to Wikipedia! If you'd like to ask a question, you can do so at the Wikipedia reference desk, which is a better place than creating an article containing your question.
Edit summaries You love to revert, we can all see that. You never, ever bother to explain why, presumably because you don't know why, you just know that you love it. If you don't have a reason, don't revert, and if you do have a reason, say what it is. 186.9.130.34

Wikipedia presents the LCC in a way that it can be easily studied: Wikipedia's version of the LCC is linkified, providing instant descriptions of each topic in the LCC. So a reader can rapidly become familiar with the LCC here, because Wikipedia articles are just a click away! In other presentations of the LCC, the reader is left to wonder what the various categories mean - if he wants to know what a term presented in the LCC is about, he or she has to look the words up (and key them in) somewhere else.

" ""Hindutva"" as defined by Savarkar baguely means Indian nationalism that draws its 'inspiration' from Hindu/Maratha culture. It cant be called Hindu extremism is broadest sense, largely since Hindu fundamentalism is an oxymoron moreover, founding fathers of Hindutva were Agnostic Hindus. Hindutva rose as a complementary movement to Marathi cultural resurgence (all founders were Marathis (specifically Marathas and Konkanastha Brahmins and till 1970's most memebers of RSS were Marathis). Hindutva in these days is a vague ideology. It differs from one propounded by Savarkar to the one practised by 'parties' like Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal. BTW I was an active HSS member till about 2003, before i left Hindutva for good. "

" I am a one-eyed football supporter, for the little that it's worth, and I agree fully with Hesperian and YellowMonkey. We aren't a ""strong national football nation""; not only are the FIFA rankings a bit of a sham (as pointed out by YellowMonkey himself), and not only is there no solid bank of references to consider our relative football ability and historical strength to be on par with that of cricket, netball etc., but the massive skill and historical disparity between Australia and the likes of Spain, Brazil, England, etc., and the relatively poor standard of the A-League and its lack of history, means that football should not be added alongside cricket etc. in the main article.

" I agree with most of what you said about Chicago. In fact, I've always said that Chicago was more conservative than a lot of smaller cities in the Great Lakes region (namely Cleveland, Detroit and Milwaukee) if for no other reason than a larger percentage of people who fit into one or more of the categories you named (person of color, union worker, ""lakefront liberal,"" and I would add bohemian/counter-culturist to the list as well). However, I don't think that's enough to say it couldn't count as a ""third coast."" New York has a republican mayor and California has a republican governor, so it's pretty obvious that the ""first"" and ""second"" coasts have their conservative segments as well. As far as Chicago culture being bland compared to the East and West coasts, you're probably right about that too. But it's not as if people on the east or west coast don't have their criticism about the other coasts' culture as well. East Coast people tend to think West Coast culture is too fluffy and superficial and West Coast people think the East Coast is too uptight and high-strung. So I don't think how Chicago/Great Lakes culture is viewed by people on the coasts shoould really have any bearing on whether or not it's a ""coast."" Besides, I don't think the purpose is to compare the Great Lakes to the Eastern or Western seaboards. I think its purpose is more to differentiate the major urban centers of the Great Lakes from the Midwest at large (which is seen as mostly small-town and conservative). And I don't think you can disagree that when compared to the rest of their states that places like Chicago, Detroit and Milwaukee do seem like ""ultra-urban"" and ""ultra-liberal"" oasises. "

Memory buffer upgrade If anyone knows more about it, there should be a discussion of the memory buffer upgrade Why for example does doubling the memory result is more than double (from 28 to 68) the number of shots in NEF (RAW) (12-bit lossless compressed mode FX mode, but no increase at all in small JPGs (it remains at 130). I suspect this is related to the fact that small files can be shited to main memory at a rate close to the maximum frame rate of the camera, but much larger files can't be transfered as quickly. But a more detailed explanation would be useful.

My initial comment that this is 'frivolous' was not meant to imply a bad faith MfD on your part (although I did consider it at first). The policy on userpages (nor much of anything on this site) is written in stoneI do not endorse your citation, nor do I agree with its application. I consider this a frivolous (and suprisingly devisive) issue. I wonder, regardless of where this vote goes, whether the world will be a better place afterwards.

The problem is that you've undercut yourself with errors of fact, mistakes in outlook, enunciation of incompatible goals, and now trying to reach for official power to remedy the situation. That's hideous, and it marks you are temperamentally incompatible. You should not behave in that way.

That's what the Safe Minds analysis was pointing out, that measuring a connection between Autism and Thimerosal with this measurement is flawed because older cases that were diagnosed would be less likely to be included in the system. Hviid denied this because older autism cases can be included in the system, which is not synonymous with saying they all were. The CDC held an illegal meeting with pharma-reps about associations found between thimerosal exposure and neurodevelopmental disorders, similar concerns over Aluminum, and about this information from the public. This isn't a theory, this is clear-cut evidence of collusion. Why? Do I ask you if you are associated in any way with Merck, Wyeth or Sanofi Aventis? 129.64.129.56
Dear GoW, you seem to have missed something obvious in your little comment - neither time that Giano finished with an old account was he blocked. That does not inspire confidence in your detective skills. Giano has, in the past, attempted to remove himself from the project by scrambling his password; and then decided to return. For Giano, it was considered more appropriate to do it under a new username rather than request a new password (Giano is not the most computer savvy of editors - he rather concentrates on the content than the means of placing it upon the page). Furthermore, very likely the vast majority of established editors are fully aware of who Giano is - and his previous accounts. WP:Alternate accounts does allow people to have different accounts, and even allows them to be used at the same time (but not in the same places, usually) - it is the undisclosed use of multiple accounts, designed to circumvent Wikipedia policy, that is not permitted. I suggest that, when you start digging for information, you make yourself familiar with all aspects of a matter, otherwise you may find that the result of your excavating is that you are simply in a deep and dark hole. Cheers,

But you have to admire the guy's persistence. Follow his user contributions. They go round the clock almost at five minute intervals with a break at 2 o'clock in the morning New York time (he lives there) and resume five or six hours later. So he does nothing else. I have to admire such dogged persistence. In fact the two human qualities I most admire are (1) that kind of persistence (2) faultless, eloquent and persuasive reasoning. A sad fact these are so rarely combined. I am hoping this may be a test case for WP itself. I don't like credentials - far more of the problem is poor and sloppy writing, so give me a good copy editor any day. I had a brief spell at Citizendium but I see what you mean about LS. What is missing is that 'citizenship points' don't count. If you have been a long time here, you have shown an ability to work with other editors, despite occasional run ins, and most other old timers are like that, in my experience. Some of them are a bit mad, but you know how to deal with them. But you have to face a constant barrage from newcomers who have a complete lack of housetraining. There is no way of showing these people the door quickly. Anyway, must go, as I'm violating the policy of leaving only messages on talk pages.

I read this distinction to say a difference between collateral damage, and a policy of government to kill people. The example used of targeting munition factories stand in contrast to Dresden. The raid on Dresden targeted civilian population, it was not the result of collataral damage to German war industries.

Jews== In response to the section below, if there were no Arab Jewish tribes, there are certainly Arab Jews. Despite the fact that many Jews in the Middle East left (or were encouraged to leave) during the 1950s and 60s to non-Arabic speaking countries, many still keep their identity as both Arabs and Jews. Continued pressure within the Jewish community to act more like the Eastern European-descendant Jews only means that it is all the more important to recognize Jewish people of Arab descent (and whose first language was often Arabic, then Hebrew) on this page. It would make sense to do so, however, with the caveat that some Arabic-speaking Jews identify both as Jews and as Arabs, while some do notjust as it's done for Christians from the Arab world on this page. ==Arab

Gaijin42 inserted fake statistics into the Defensive Gun Use article and Removed the accurately cited statistics I added His references do not say what he says they say. He is unable to produce a quoted citation showing the 33 million figure. He is making it up. If you want to have an encyclopedia with made up facts, where someone can add a figure of 33 million that they invented and which isn't in the article, please go ahead. But I don't think that's an encyclopedia anymore. As for me, I added a cited , with inline citations reference showing that there are only 1600 verified DGUs yearly. Not only that, Gaijins claim is not logically possible. Any elementary logic shows that what he is claiming is impossible. Think about what you are doing in allowing a vandal like Gaijin to insert fake statistics into articles to suit a political agenda when he has already been topic banned from this area and was just reinstated. He is indeed committing fraud by inserting statistics that aren't in the reference. Also, his reference is 20 years old and is intellectually discredited years ago. You might as well replace the Period Table page with Phlogiston theory.

" Jimbo Wales and Justin Berry It seems the owner of Wikipedia, Jimbo Wales, has developed a close personal relationship with 19 year old Justin Berry, the former underage camwhore and adult porn webmaster recently profiled in a series of New York Times articles by writer Kurt Eichenwald. At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, ""pedophile trolling,"" which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship. Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a ""personal attack,"" and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale. Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are ""copyright violations"", even though Wikipedia is filled with ""fair use"" pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs. Mr. Berry is a news story. I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article. Way to go Jimbo, you're a rancid agenda-pushing piece of shit, and I greatly regret having contributed to your encyclopedic turd-pile. Perhaps you should rename this endeavor ""The Oprah Encyclopedia."" Fuck you. "

First I would like to start with Zakir Naik's statement regarding Death to Apostates. Zakir Naik believes (that according to Islam) a person who leaves Islam must be executed. This is an important viewpoint from a renown Islamic scholar, thus this opinion must be included in the article. Although this statement was there in the article it was removed by certain editors kept on insisting that the sources were not reliable. I would therefore like to list a series of sources that confirm this statement was made. Please view , , , or to see him saying this live on television. You can also get videos of his lectures in India/Pakistan. Various articles have been written on it and there are several web pages discussing it ( just to list a few , ). Thus there is no doubt on the importance of this statement given how thoroughly it has been discussed by people all over India and elsewhere. Furthermore since the statement was made on television, so I do nor see a problem with reliability of sources. Editors who disagree should explain why they disagree before removing related content from the article.
Julian Green http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Green http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Johnson http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Johnson Everywhere, it is listed that they are American-German. Even the next sentence identifies his dual citizenship. The dude is GERMAN in that he barely speaks English. Everything he does is in German. He's German who happens to play for the USA. HE IS GERMAN!!! There is no way around it. Just like Klinsmann.

" Ah, that's well motivated, then. We shouldn't repeat the lists of languages, and without those, there was nothing left for the article but a dictionary-type definition. But if we have something substantial like a reconstruction, the page is definitely warranted. I've restored it for you. Tagged one point: ""old"" and ""recent"" are meaningless except for historical stages and non-genealogical descent. If we assume monogenesis, all languages are equally old. "
" List Format It seems that the entire format of the list has changed recently, and I'm not sure it's for the better. It seems to be including a lot of information that's not necessary, and omitting useful info such as original airdate. It says that this article is ""part of WikiProject List of Television Episodes."" However, it's not even following the structure. If this is to comply with the standards of the episode lists, I suggest we rename the article (List of Doctor Who Episodes, as per the naming convention) and add a redirect for the current title, as well as updating the table.

The info I tried to include from these sources is almost fully available from various alternative press sources, as direct interviews with involved persons or as review from reporters on the case. The number of such interviews and other sources will doubtlessly grow with time. So, there's really no need to use the particular sources you fight against so much. But, at this moment my feeling is that the majority of active skeptics here just don't want a neutral article about the subject, and I feel I've really done my best for Wikipedia. Maybe I should give you some more time to evaluate the case and understand that your position is biased, so I don't have to fight an epic battle for each small info I include. Or maybe life will bring about more info on the case. In either case, my feeling is that you don't deserve more of my time and attention here for now. Thanks.

I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use.

Hello Hi, I just wanted to say that I appreciated your work for fairness and accuracy that you did at the List of Scientologists article a while back. I was thinking that you may be interested in checking out a discussion about an article that is going on at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Werner Erhard vs. Columbia Broadcasting System and Talk:Werner Erhard vs. Columbia Broadcasting System.
More rubbish. This page contains 0.000001% of the actual amount of news coverage there's been of the Olympics, so that claim is clearly nonsense. There are no differing interpretations here at all, there's people talking about policies that they know about, and then there's you, who can barely even match up a policy to the issue it governs - NOTABILITY doesn't control content in articles, RECENT doesn't bar the inclusion of recent incidents, NOTNEWS doesn't forbid the use of journalistic sources, WP:ILIKEIT only applies to deletion debates, etc etc etc. You can claim all you want that incidents weren't controversial, but merely pointing out that the word 'controversial' isn't in the source is about the thinnest argument you could ever produce to support it (and in the case of Kim Collins, it's actually a lie, there are soucres calling it controversial, I don't think you even bother looking half the time).

I have to say I agree with some of the above and disagree with other bits, but I think that has it right. Placing this article into a category inherently does just that, it categorizes it into a topic heading. But adding a navigational template at the very bottom is not characterizing anything, it is simply a tool for other editors, in other words, if your interest has been piqued after reading this article, then here are some others that might interest you. So I'm going with no on Category:Cult related books, and yes on . .

His KKK was non-violent but just a pro-whites organisation against affirmative action and illegal immigration as he used it to patrol the American-Mexican borders. He LEFT his KKK in 1980 which was the same time he LEFT the Democrats! Robert Byrd was a member of a KKK WHY ARE YOU NOT SMEARING AGAINST HIM???

":I know I may be wrong, but notice the article says ""It should be mentioned that all color values from #000000 - #FFFFFF (16,777,215 colors) are valid."" Wouldn't that be incorrect, as 255 = 16,581,375? Again, I know that I'm the one who's most likely wrong, and that someone would have noticed by now if the stated number of colors was incorrect, but I just wanted to ask. "

(UTC) I agree with User:Man with two legs that the graph is extremely misleading. See this quote about (or maybe from?) Edward Tufte: Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points. In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points. The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source) The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area). If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima. Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller. On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself. 98.218.195.90 12:41, 6 July 2010

I also have no objection anymore to removing the square brackets if it is done entirely consistently throughout the article; in the citations, however, the brackets may still be needed so that the dates are bolded as the 2008-09-09 style is. As one who had to restore all the square brackets, which took a lot of time, I will not be the editor who removes them. (There are square brackets around years in some of the charts created by other editors; I just helped to develop the charts, following their prevailing format. Please do not alter (and thus try to maintain) the prevailing citation format; it takes forever to code those citations.
" Hey...... I did NOT attack other wikipedians. Get your facts straight. btw, certain things are more important. I really don't give a damn about your stupid ""rules"". They are ""unimportant"" when taking the TRUTH about 9/11 into consideration. Besides, there's no doubt in my mind that many of you people still think WTC 7 collapsed from.. cough cough.. ""fire and debris"". This shows the overall stupidity level of you people. And regarding attacking people, look through the archives in some of the 9/11 pages and you'll see ""moderators"" behaving like little children by calling people names, and ignoring scientific facts and physical laws. You think censoring the truth about 9/11 is going to prevent the truth from coming out? Are you American? Then consider yourself a traitor to the country because that's exactly what you are. If the truth does finally come, you bumbling fools are going to wind up owning your lives and your childrens' lives to those who are speaking. You wanna censor it? That would be an act of TREASON.

" I think your understanding is incorrect. LR(1) grammars are also parseable in O(n) time; see: Knuth, D. (1965) ""On the translation of languages from left to right."" Information and Control, 8, 607639. LR languages are strictly more powerful: every LL(1) grammar is LR(1). The converse is not true: grammars containing left recursion may be LR(1) but not LL(1). In short, LR(1) parsers are strictly more powerful, but more difficult to write. That's why parser-generators for LR(1) and related classes, are popular. I think you might be confusing LR(1) with ""generalized LR"" or ""GLR"". This algorithm can parse any context free grammar in worst-case O(n^3), but is vastly more powerful than either LR(1) or LL(1) in fact, you can reduce any instance of binary matrix multiplication to an instance of context-free (and hence GLR) parsing, so we'll unlikely to ever find an algorithm that runs faster than the fastest matrix-multiplication algorithm.

" Q. How are the barrels rotated? A. The rotational force is delivered by two hydraulic drive motors operating off of both main aircraft hydraulic systems (A+B). The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly. This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts. The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum. Q. How long is typical spin-up time? A. While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft. Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate. Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish. During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur. The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be ""water washed"" (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades. Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose."

And yes, I'll consider something else either making it hardcoded and more appropriate for the moment, alternative tags, proposing a template for similar situations, or a combo of the previous.

I'm wondering, if we decided to force admins >6 years to re-run, how many that would affect?

I don't know why you're pushing the view that only football 'supporters' are deciding here. Supporters of the move included an administrator apparently from the USA who has little involvement in Australian sporting articles, a member of Project AFL and another editor who spends their time on Rugby League articles, there was ample time for anyone who disagreed to join in the conversation and this went through all the proper channels, only one person made a truly valid piece of opposition based on the actual move issue (instead of being opposed just because this article is notable and another non-notable AFL fixture was deleted). As for making the judgment, I'm merely laying out the way I see this discussion as having gone, and requesting the move & close as per what the consensus is after a very long discussion period.

You don't get to act to like an anti-semite and bully people you disagree with and then cry foul when editors point out that you are abusive. Your actions speak for themselves. You first actions as an admin were to impost your POV on a contentious article. And you statement that you don't want to block me is a blatant lie. you have said just the opposite in the past and participated in accusations of socking to try and get me blocked indefinitely. This is on top of our long running conflict. So you lie as much as you want and you can block me if I point out the facts that demonstrate you're a liar, but bigotry, bullying, bias, prejudice, discrimination and other abuses are wrong.

How can you label HIM as Alternative Rock??? The latest album might have some elements of it, but HIM is NOT an Alternative Rock band... They have Gothic Rock elements, Metal elements, Glam Rock elements and much more...they are love metal
This is one case where the American angle on the history is somewhat understandable. Every major development in shotguns since the 1870s has been the work of American companies or individuals (see John Browning), and it remains one of the most widespread firearms in that country despite no bans on other types of gun ownership. Also, as a police service weapon, it is not nearly as popular in Europe or Asia as in America.
Thanks for your comment on Talk:Amdo. I will keep the points about language in mind. I grew frustrated because I had run into Blnguyen acting in concert with Khoikhoi in exactly the same way before (on Qoigyijabu I think it was) - where I forgot myself and got blocked for 3RR, so I wasn't particularly pleased to see the two of them doing the same thing again. I will, however, keep to non-emotive language from now on. (Talk)

1 Year of the Collaboration of the Week Hello again to those of WikiProject Oregon. It is time again for another Collaboration of the Week. The last two weeks were a Stub Improvement Drive, and thank you to those who improved any Stubs. This week marks the one week anniversary of the COTW, so a brief highlight reel: At least 10 DYKs Three articles passed GA after being listed at COTW Probably around 25 articles started Almost all Top importance articles are now better than Stub class And now on with our countdown. This week we have two requests, the Willamette Meteorite and Tom McCall. Hopefully we can get both to GA quality. Click here to opt out of these messages, or click here to make a suggestion for a future COTW. Thank you.

Before accusing me of edit-warring please make sure of your facts. If you look at the article in question's history view you would see that nowhere did I make more than 3 reverts in a 24 hour period. You would also see on the talk page that there is a thorough discussion and explanation of the changes made. It is strange that the user who continually reverts my edits has not been given a similar warning and I wonder if you could perhaps explain the reason for this?

They are not the same. That's the problem, the dictionary disagrees with you. The Olympic Committee establishes and sets rules, but they don't conceive or create them. If someone else had the idea of the Golden Eagle award then the statement is wrong, as the sentence claims the idea originated with him for the award. He was in a position to 'establish' it, but it does not mean he 'created' it.

Beer? Hi Matthew, I'm in London July 25 to August 4. I think we should have our annual beer. Incidentally I'm in Finland at the moment attending DebConf5. The travel advice suggested a cheap way of getting to Helsinki is to fly to Estonia and take the short ferry trip across the water. But then I thought I'm probably on some Estonian customs black list. The prospect of a strip search by enthusiastic friends of he who does not want to be identified as an Estonian customs officer made me think again: I flew direct. Imagine: By Wikipedia rules if they missed the four opportunities (in and out, in and out) they could catch up with me 10 months later. Yes, I know, the logic escapes me too.

Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that ""he is one of the fairest players I have managed"" holds no weight since: 1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years. 2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much. In summary I think that the line should be changed to: ""The incident brought to light the true extent of Henry's bad sportsmanship."" Simon"

"I apologize for my comments toward iss246. After 3 months of him maintaining the defamatory, baseless comments left on his talk page, and even after I had corrected their validity. I also apologize and can see the fault in me mis-using the talk page on the health psychology article, by creating a separate header on the talk page, drawing attention to iss246 continuing the personalization rather than editing. After User talk:Beeblebrox made a number of wise comments to us both and I directly quote these comments after iss246 complained over me calling iss246 a ""troll"": ""I am not at all sure why this has been brought to my talk page, but I will provide some advice for the both of you: Stop calling each other names, including ""troll"" or engaging in other personal attacks. That is never the way to solve a dispute, be it on or off wiki. Consider pursuing some form of dispute resolution Just to re-iterate, claiming any sort of real-life credential is irrelevant as we rely on reliable sources, not personal expertise. Consider whether this is really worth arguing over or if it might just be time for both of you to let it go hope this helps. Beeblebrox (talk) I was just about to take Beeblebrox's excellent advice and request formal dispute resolution instead. However iss246 ignored Beeblebrox's sound advice and took calling iss246 a troll to the Administrator's noticeboard. Could Drmies please detail any other reason for my 2 week block, to help me understand and further change any future editing behaviour and knowledge? Thank you. "

" It is true that ""Lots of more modern arts hang without frames."" But the Signac paintings are 100 years old. And even contemporary art in a Wikipedia article benefits from frames in their presentation to the viewer. Virtually any image benefits from lines echoing the delineation of the (usually rectangular) image. This is somewhat similar to the way scare quotes call attention to a word or phrase. The scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration. We have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article. If we are going to argue that Wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail, then why bother including images of famous paintings at all? I think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way. Therefore it seems like a poor move to reduce their usefulness to the reader by removing the framing lines and the emphasis those lines impart to the image. "

" Ringnes stated it is ok for members of JW to socialize with non-members, even though befriending other members of JW is described as ""the ideal"". Stating the one thing without mentioning the other (it is in general considered ok for JW to socialize with non-members/a significant portion of JW do occasionally socialize with non-members), is inaccurate, as it represents a selective use of information that does not include notable views (Holden did also described an inconsistent practice on the matter). I've supported contexts, and information from Norwegian sources, which could be used for support for both views, as the purpose of the article is to give a correct view of the topic (I didn't have to mention ""the ideal-part or any of the fractions given in the Dispute noticeboard, or quote to give any context, as no one of the non-Norwegians users would ever find out anyway).

"Hello! Am researching and writing a paragraph or two to replace the simple allusion to critics pinning (ignorantly usually) the space opera label on work by Simmons. It is taking more time than I would have hoped so I am taking a 5 minute break on doing this to tell you I am working on it. Simmons does not write classic ""hard science"" science fiction like the old masters Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein. Instead he writes a form of grandiose social SF which is sometimes related to the social SF or Soft science fiction tradition of Bradbury, Le Guin, Vance and others. I wanted to do fast justice to his continuation, in his own very particular style, of that tradition by making a rapid allusion to the fact that his literary approach is really not space opera. Well, yes that ""justice"" was too fast and I am correctng it! By the way it is customary to add messages at the _bottom_ of somebody's talk page, and not at the top like you did. The fact that it is at the bottom does not make it less visible. 18:36, 27 Jun 2004 (UTC)"

" Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here. I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent). Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase. As to the portal, thanks for letting me know, I was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing, I thought it was transcluded. Learn something new every day ;) And lastly, I still think that it should be on the main page.

Dr. Michael E. Schmidt was the head of a committee of three students who were chosen to select the school mascot and colors. One website suggests that a student parent committee selected Brookwoods colors and mascott. This is completely untrue. No adults were involved in voting for the school colors or mascott. Adults had suggested the Brookwood Bears and the color of Carolina Blue , but in a 3-0 vote the student committee led by Michael E. Schmidt selected the Bronco and the colors burgandy and gold. The Brookwood school song and fight song were selected by Dr. Michael E. Schmidt and Brookwoods first band director the late Stewart Hughes. Laura Zieker BHS first choir teacher wrote the words to Brookwoods school song. Both songs were based upon the songs from Tucker High School. Dr. Michael E. Schmidt arranged the first arrangement of Brookwood High Schools fight song. The BHS administration had originally wanted Brookwoods colors to be Orange and Blue like the Denver Broncos, but the student committee led by a Parkview High School student [ hs senior Dr. Schmidt] rejected those colors because they are the same colors as Brookwoods rival Parkview High School. [ Both of the two other students on that committe were junior transfers from South Gwinnett HS] The colors chosen were maroon and gold which were based upon the colors of Florida State University. The runner-up choice for Brookwoods color was Carolina blue. The original Brookwood HS logo/mascott selected by the three student committee was a full bronco surrounded by a horseshoe. The current logo is that of a bronco head. The second choice for the school mascot was a bear.

This all goes to prove how EASILY manipulated LIBERAL RACE-BAITERS are. Especially when aided and abetted by their COMRADES in the mainstream LIBERAL media. Think back now. Fox was CHIDED for not having enough stories. Liberals LOVE to count, don't they? Except what they claim never ADDS up. FoxNews, who were still on the wrong side of this, have been vindicated ONCE AGAIN for not jumping on the Justice for Thug Trayvon Bandwagon. But the liberals will just move on and pretend that this didn't happen. Or claim that Zimmerman's injuries were SELF-inflicted. You think I'm kidding? Read the comment sections. These liberal race baiters are the most DELUSIONAL idiots ever. When you look at the BLOOD pouring out from Geo Zimmernan's head on that one photo, the first thought you should have is 'Wow!

" I'm not sure that ""many"" said any such thing, nor what value that would have even if they had done - this isn't a game of promises or about bargaining and haggling; nor is it a democracy where what the majority say counts. In any event, I know that I repeatedly and consistently said that ""Taiwan"" should of course be used more in article text, and that it would be odd to have one terminology for the main article title and another for references elsewhere, eg in text, which of course it would. I and others also said it would not change in every instance or every context, which of course it should not, not least more historical ones. Anyway, the President of Taiwan may well need to be referred to and named as such, if that is indeed the common name.

" PROD I just deleted a prod tag from this page for the following reasons: The ""prodder"" didn't give any reason for deleting the article There are no obvious problems with the article - it is well sourced, etc. The prod was likely bad faith, based on the prodders comments at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Barnegat Fund Management and User talk:Djbarnes. The Barnegat Fund Management article, whith which User:Djbarnes has a potential COI, was deleted for lack of notability, and now the user is prodding other hedge fund articles without giving reasons.

stop editing this, you dumbass. why do you have to be such a bitch? the ghosts of bill maas' past will haunt you forever!!! MWAHAHHAHAA
The edit you pointed out as a supposed example of POV-pushing was not POV-pushing at all. I removed a reference to Steve Stockman running in the Republican primary against John Cornyn. I removed it because there were two other references to Stockman's primary challenge to Cornyn already in the article. Also, in the next edit that I did I added a better reference for the primary run. I was the editor that put the original reference to the primary challenge in the Cornyn article in the first place. See, if it bald-faced lies like that one that you just wrote here that get in trouble. You are a POV warrior in the first order. You attempt to slander people that don't agree with your editingjust like you are attempting to do here to me. You have ZERO evidence for allegationsjust made up, bald-faced lies. I am not in Seattle and I am a sock of either of those people. I am not a sock of anyone. You edit in bad faith and the way that you have been treating me in an example of your bad faith editing. I don't have anything to be concerned about in relation to your sock allegation. I've known that all along. I said it before you did. I did not need you to tell me. Your apologies are out right lies also because when you apologize you come up with five or six more allegations against whomever you are apologizing to. All of your apologies are fraudulent, just like your sock allegations. Please just stop responding to me because you're fake apologies just embarrass you further and make you look worst. Stop it. Go away.

Yes.. pre-embryological... dunno about anybody else but wikipedia seem big enough for all of us... so i for one am not proposing we go anywhere!! although I wonder if (one day) a 'wiki-book' dedicated to information for patient's could be good? also wonder if a highly formalised future wiki could seriously compete with medical textbooks. but that is just pie in the sky thinking. btw i too think the 'mess' is fantastic... I guess we should all recruit new members! I claim Alteripse as my recruit (gedday Alteripse!) - still have a long way to catch up with JFDW tho! the proposal i've made is really just an add on suggestion to the good work already done you all.

Users removing warnings from thier talk pages I recently came accross your comment on User_talk:HiImPhil regarding his removal of warnings from his talk page. Warning removal, while frowned upon, is not prohibited by any official policy. See WP:USER and Wikipedia:Centralized_discussion/Removing_warnings. While it is certainly reasonable to ask users not to remove warnings, it is not a good idea to suggest that they are not allowed to. While the warning removal does make fighting vandalism a bit slower, there is not a consesus to prohibit it. Thanks

" Elelland Hello Humus I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a ""kangaroo court"" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus. The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism. Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted. So I studied Eleland a little. I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles. Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem. Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script. Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have? Can anything be done?

Kumar Rao the idiot fanatic While you seem to act like the authority on the history. Can you explain why there is not much evidence in terms of ancient literature work in Telugu in Telugu script ??? Nannaya has been considered as Adi Kavi 11th century(First Poet) in Telugu ? It is not without a reason Telugu script has been linked to old-Kannada script. It has been well documented by many scholars and in many books. It is also widely accepted by Telugu ppl as well. Read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nannayya....he knew Kannada and wrote in Telugu. http://www.ancientscripts.com/telugu.html http://www.answers.com/topic/telugu-script http://www.omniglot.com/writing/kannada.htm http://www.bookrags.com/Andhra_Pradesh http://tulu-research.blogspot.com/search/label/Kadamba http://bhashaindia.com/Patrons/LanguageTech/TeluguScript.aspx Don't talk about Kannada (as you have no fuck in knowledge about it).

" - I didn't object to any of your additions, my problem was with some of the stuff you removed. You removed the bit about reviewers being divided on whether or not the game was worth playing if they had access to the Genesis version, which I found puzzling because even your version of the reception section contains reviewers saying that it was distinct enough from the Genesis version to want to play it, or that the reader should search for the Genesis version. 2 sources discuss that even without the gaming sanctuary page. Anyways, I only reverted everything else as it was the only way to restore that information. I feel a hybrid version is the best approach. msg me "

" Sbharris, your arguments will improve once you learn something about homeopathy. For instance, we do not ""treat"" symptoms; we use symptoms to find the remedy. Further, whether a homeopath has or doesn't have medical training, we use whatever diagnosis the patient has been given, but then, we put more emphasis on whatever unusual or idiosyncratic symptoms the person has. And for the record, there is plenty of in-fighting in homeopathy...200 years worth...and different styles of using high and low potencies. Once you learn something about homeopathy, you may be dangerous. Until then, your lack of knowledge about this subject is simply amusing, not convincing. Still, I will AGF, and I ask you to consider avoid the strawman argument. Talk "

July 2006 (UTC) I understand I am a bit late in this discussion and it has probably already concluded and everyone is probably already over it but I have to say the following; American English is quite simply English for the stupid man (and of course your country would require it.) Your version of English is over-simplified. I am sick of Americans always thinking that their way is the only way. Why shouldn't you accept our spelling? Webster was incorrect in his changing of the English language. If I was to start spelling things incorrectly would that mean that it is a new way of spelling and I would be a reformist rather than an idiot? I think not. 09:04, 17
While I remain unconvinced that I've broken any policies in spirit, perhaps I should explain that I've been acting with the frustration of one falsely accused and the disillusionment of one having the Wikipedian ideals abased and defaced before his eyesaggressively by one user, and passively by the rest. A quick glance at my edit log shows that I have scarce made a contribution to Wikipedia in days, other than to defend some actions, deny others, and, in short, to feed a troll. is in need of professional helpmost likely a nannyand I haven't enough free time to provide it unpaid.

Notice Hello. This message is being sent to inform you that there is currently a discussion at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents regarding an issue with which you may have been involved. Thank you.
Reading through the history, it looks like you were trying to improve that article. Particularly good is that you added a source. Unfortunately, both the Amazon description and the now-deleted article appear to have been largely copied from the publisher's description, but if you would like to create a new article from scratch, just click here and start writing. The system will let you know that you are recreating a deleted article, but that is fine. When you are adding references to an article that does not currently contain any, you also need to create a section where they will be automatically listed. Simply copy the following text near the bottom of the article (as it appears on the page, not the source used to generate this presentation): == References == {{reflist}} and you will get a nicely formatted list of sources cited by the article instead of that nasty red text. Please let me know if I can help with anything else, - 2/0 (cont.)

Latest issue of Surrey Hants Star (Thurs 11 May 2006), the local newspaper for Aldershot, has a letter describing how bad Aldershot is, people fear to go out on the streets, abusive yobs etc etc. What eveyone who either knows or lives in Aldershot knows to be the truth. What was here was a fair and accurate description of Aldershot, that is until the page was vandalised by Waterspoon who decided to strip out everything he did not like. It is people like Wankerspoon who are giving Wikipedia a bad name. He should be blocked from changing pages on Wikipedia.

":::""WP:DTTR is an essay."" I didn't say anything about WP:DTTR. I pointed out what is a practice according to members of the community, something I would not merely dismiss out of hand as you seem to do. ""At what point does an editor here pass your threshold for what constitutes a non-newbie?"" As for Delta/Triangle (sorry, I don't know how to make triangles on my keyboard), I concluded at the time that he was a newbie for the reasons I mentioned above. It was an explanation of my perception at the time, and not some type of value judgment. But if you really want an answer to your question, I'd say an editor is no longer a newbie when they have a reasonable command of how Wikipedia works, such that they do not make false accusations of copyright infringement, make a point of communicating with image uploaders, and familiarize themselves with the right way to communicate with members of the community. ""If you believe images should be retained without there being a rationale for that use present..."" Thank you for making it clear that you either are not reading my messages, or are being deliberately churlish. I didn't say anything about images being retained without a rationale. I already explained clearly above the matter regarding the rationale, and if you're either too illiterate or too lazy to read and comprehend this, then perhaps you should not engage me in discussion. I made the edit summary that I thought was appropriate, as I'm quite tired of obnoxious deletionists like Triangle who make false accusations and no attempt to communicate with others, as well as persistent liars like yourself who think repeatedly putting words in other people's mouths constitutes ""discussion"". If you don't like my edit summaries, then tough shit. "

For example the temple tank and surroundings need some real cleaning. The temple also needs some face lift. SO this mail is an attempt to first get hold of all like minded people who have visited this temple and those who value this temple highly either because of ancestral liks or otherwise. In a way this is an attempt to create a commuinty and later on we can decide collectively on what can be done. SO who ever

Hey, you squinty-eyed Jap. Go to the Japanese Wikipedia, where you belong.
Fatty You are the most disgusting fat, worthless piece of crap to ever grace wikipedia. Losers who still live with their parents, work in walmart and pretend to be an anarchist are worthless swine with nothing relevent to add to an encyclopedia. Please leave this place, you pathetic drag on humanity. You make me sick, you pathetic cretin. I hope you feel nothing but unhappiness for the end of your days, fool. I hope you suffer in your inequity, weighed down by your massive manbreasts, making women point at you and laugh in the street and making men thank god they aren't as ugly as you. You look like a paedophile, and probably are, children in the street run into their houses when they see your approach: A truly vile beast of a man, with no intellect, no integrity, no idea of how pathetic he is, you maintain a website and believe this is virtuous - what a waste of human thought you truly are. A curse on humanity is what you are, and the sooner wikipedia is without you the better for all. I beseech you, please leave this place and never come back - turn your back on civilised society and take to the wild - maybe there you shall find some solace. Even in the very wilds of the planet there are animals who will appreciate you for what you are, if you are capable of a modicum of kindness. Please consider this, for you are a drag on humanity.
Well so now I'm apparently not allowed to posts facts to support an article just because I may know someone. Hmm, sounds like it would be easier to provide facts if I did know someone. Anyways since I can't maybe wikipedia should do reasearch on the facts presented to them instead of completely ignoring them. Go ahead and file your damned report, I'm getting sick of you people pretending like this is an open encyclopedia anyways. You've been present with more than enough well documented facts by people other than myself that fall well within Wikipedia's guidelines and they still have yet to be posted. So all I have to say is take that report and stick it up your ass.

" Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary. It is nevertheless a content dispute. Neither the repeated switching of images nor the edit summaries that you consider misleading amount to vandalism, per Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types of vandalism and Wikipedia:Vandalism#What is not vandalism. Donald Albury It was vandalism, but not mine. Your images have extremely bad lighting and are not encyclopedic quality in the least. One of them replaced a photo of a street in the article for that street Brickell Avenue and doesn't even show the street. THE ARTICLE IS ABOUT THE STREET. Also, you're supposed to answer a talk on the same page (Yours') that it initiated on, not put the answer on the initiators page so there are 2 half conversations on two separate pages. I suggest you read a bit more about Wikipedia rules and stop vandalizing articles with your crappy poor lighting amateur photography from car windows. 66.176.139.222 "
Where did the Jews for Holocaust come from? The statistic shows that Germany and Austria together had together about 2,000,000 Jewish population. It is stated that the Jewish population did drop by about 6,000,000 during the holocaust. Where did the Germans take those Jews from? Something does not add up here.

"==BLACK SLANG== This article suggests that using ""bitch"" to describe a young woman is exclusive to hip hop culture. This is not the case. This is THE prominent term to describe a woman in the African-American community. How many black people do you know who actually call a woman a woman? None. They all say ""bitch"" as in ""Ah fucked dis bitch las' naht nigga. She wa' FAAAHN."" Black people will NEVER say ""woman"" because it is ingrained in their culture to be derogatory towards women! THAT is why it is used in hip hop, because that is black entertainment. Misogyny is a crucial element of African0American culture and this is why black people throw around the word ""bitch"" as a synonym for ""woman"". It's the same way how black people never call a song a ""song"" they will always call it a ""track"" and if you call it a song the black people will think you're a ""square"" ad ""not hip."" That's how they are and it should be in the article. "

Questionable Edit on Your Part
"I'm concerned about how problems are being ""addressed"" here. Jza84 summarized what this page is merely about (""merely about how the UK is subdivided""). There are two problems with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page. First, in terms of dividing territory geographically, there is no ""merely"" involved. Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue. Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution. Jsa84 could learn from this attitude. The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun. This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom. I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community. Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused. Dylan Hunt "

I'll take a look at some of the other FLs.

Additionally, an IP just added notability tags to several episode pages, all of which I removed. As it was an IP - who used the films notability tag anyway and some of the episodes were GAs - I think its was more likely vandilism than a real cause for concern, but there you go. 2

" Agreed. We really should try to stick to the subject of the article at hand. And looking through the Jeremy Clarkson article I see there really isn't a lot about his penchant for speed. It's mentioned, but just briefly, alongside his clean driving record. However in searching via Google, I found this article, http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12529-1890873_2,00.html This to me seems rather striking, to have somebody talking so openly about speed. Maybe we could change the article around to be, In spite of his penchant for speed, Clarkson holds a clean driving licence. None the less, he is not especially reluctant to discuss the subject of speed. In a November 2005 article in ""The Sunday Times"", Mr. Clarkson wrote, while discussing the Bugatti Veyron, ""On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240mph"", and later, in the same article, ""From behind the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldnt believe me"". Could we write that ? These two quotes are rather remarkable, in my opinion, and worth mentioning in the article. They demonstrate his honest and frank manner of discussing his travels across Europe. And we could just leave it to the reader to decide if he is talking about going 240mph on public roads, or whatever. I realize you may feel differently about Mr. Clarkson than I do, but none the less, these two quotes do clarify his penchant for speed, and are worth mentioning, alongside his clean driving record, I would say.

They were unarmed and there was no remote control for the bomb that had not been planted at the time they were shot, however nobody knew that until afterwards and the ECHR report makes it clear that a radio device was anticipated. The verdict of the Gibraltar court was lawful killing and that remains, so to say they were 'murdered' is pushing a POV which is not factually correct. Claiming ranks for terrorists in plain clothes is a debate I'd rather not get into.

Kung hei fat choi Hi Schmucky, regarding your comment on the Admin. Incident page. I am not assigning blame anywhere. I was merely summarising (in the most neutral way possible) the evidence available in the history pages. For your part, I think it was a bit unwise of you to rashly move the page in the way that you did. Perhaps some more participation in the discussion before making such a drastic move would be useful.

Police violence Am I the only one who is disturbed by on some of the Media coverage of the protest and police action. The news I saw described Chinese police are beating protesters, even to the point of bleeding, yet, I found out the footage shown was actually in Nepal. I was watching news coverage of the protest in Tibet, and saw police chasing Buddhist monks with sticks and beating them with it, and monks and civilians covered with blood. I thought the bahavior of the police were disgusting, yet later I saw the same footages and photos of those polices on the internet, but the description is that those police beating and protests were actually happening in Nepal and not in Tibet. It looks very similar to images of Tibet, but I dont know why the Television media would pass these images for Tibet protest though.207.69.139.142

" Dirtiness of thermonuclear bombs An unsupported statement is made that ""... the smaller a thermonuclear bomb is, the ""dirtier"" it is ..."" This is misleading, if not untrue. Bombs are optimised for an entirely different purpose. It is true that in small and large bombs, the bulk of the yield is from fission, but this is a design decision, and can easily be eliminated by using a non-fissile tamper material. The secondary of a small multi-stage bomb is just another boosted fission stage, fusion yield negligible. The largest bomb ever tested (~50MT) was fairly clean, but only because the fissile tamper was removed from the secondary to reduce contamination. Small ultra-clean bombs have also been tested. The article is about the current art of laser-driven ICF. Fission-driven ICF was the first mechanism used and has been proven, so a summary definitely belongs here. The details of using large explosions for power belong in another more general nuclear power article. "

"::::::: Hi everyone this is the first time I've closely examined this page. I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the ""rules"" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (""blocking pedestrian traffic"" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called ""crowd control policing"", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact. Thanks for your work, and perhaps you can offer some guidance as to how first-person expertise can properly be used to make sure a wiki article is factual and not based on flawed or incomplete media interpretation.

Hi Cee Gee why dont you try to be a bit more cooperative. When using the Category Mediterranean Region, Turkey, I see no conflict to the principles stated in Wikipedia:Overcategorization. Province and geographical region are two different things. In most cases, the region doesnt cover the whole province. For example, half of Mula Province is in Aegean Region and the the other half is in Mediterranean Region. Similarly different parts of Kahramanmara Province are in four different regions.

I also like how you got so upset that your minor incident was not going to be included that went ahead and removed the incidents that the Irish aviation authorities labeled as serious incidents and had been in the article for a few years. Harry do wiki a favor and stay away from aviation articles, you obviously have the same insight into aviation as a two year old has into biology. Do me a favor, since this is two personal attacks in 24hrs, PLEASE permanently block me so I don't waste anymore of my time on this excuse of an encyclopedia.

Thanks for everything you've done in this matter. I have a fear that the user may come back with another account in the future to harass me some more, so although the disruption is over I'd just like to state that here. When a user creates an account simply to make gross accusations about other users and call them the worst thing possible then yes I get a bit worried about it unfortunately, and worried that it has a possibility of happening again. Hopefully its all over, but I just wanted this written somewhere so people could see this and my reasoning if it ever happens again. Thanks again.
Vandalism is when you come along and delete vaid, substantiated content because you want to. Adding valid, substantiated content is not vandalism shithead. Try to ban me all you like. You will have no luck. I'm right, you're wrong.
DeeperQA? == As a cook I often need to find recipes and their closely related variations in the same way a lawyer or doctor may need to find cases and their variations. In the past I resolved this need by asking the computer questions by means of submitting keywords. Today the method I use is quite different. Today I find recipes and their variations by query - not by my query of the computer but by the computer's query of me. What makes this better is the time I save repeating keyword submissions to refine responses and find the answer I need. What makes this possible is the computers ability to minimize the number of questions it must ask. The technique is described here. ==

(and if anybody starts talking about airliner 'vaporisation' on here, then wikipedia is already worthless and I am wasting my time. its like a film trailer: ""From the people who brought you the magic bullet and WMDs, comes a story beyond all rationality."") If the plane hit the ground before impact, why is the lawn unmarked? A 757 impact is either: (a) strong enough to bring down a steel reinforced world trade centre or: (b) not even strong enough to create more than a 9 metre hole in three concrete sections of the pentagon.

" Name of Georgia I recently edited the section about the etymology of ""Georgia"" to reflect the fact that there is no definitive theory as to the name's origin. My changes were reverted and now the section is back to the version with questionable assertions and weasel words, such as ""probably"", ""may be"", ""clearly"", ""presumably"", etc. It is not the prerogative of wikipedia editors to create a synthesis of different theories to reach a single ""probable"", ""clear"" or ""presumable"" conclusion. For this reason, I would like to rework the section in the following way, which I think is appropriate given the divergence of theories. Any additions or suggestions are also welcome. "

Troublesome sentence Paleolithic Europeans seem to have been a homogenous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and then expanded into Europe during the Mesolithic period This is false. I cannot recall any study which asserts confidently that Palaeolithic Europe was genetically homogeneous. If there is one, it would require in-line citation. I think whoever wrote the sentence has confused themselves. The studies have, rather, shown that Mesolithic Europe became more homogenepus because of population bottlenecking with subsequent expansion. The bottlenecking did not cause a homogeneous Palaeolithic population becuase the events occurred subsequently.

":A certain admin will block you if you tell the truth about a certain user's dirty tricks. But she won't do anything to the user who pulled the dirty tricks. She only ""punishes"" the victim of the dirty tricks. The perpetrator goes scot free. That's ""Wikipedia justice"", as practiced by admin pschemp. Apparently she wants no one to know that Ryulong deleted my request for help on Khoikhoi's talk page, falsely describing my request for help as ""vandalism"" in his edit summary. Oops! Was it ""uncivil"" again, for me to tell the truth? If so, then prosecutors in court will never be able to tell the truth about crimes, because it would be an ""uncivil"" ""personal attack"" to use words such as ""lie"", ""dishonest"", ""vandal"", ""thief"", ""murderer"", ""rapist"", etc. The judge would get too upset by such ""uncivil comments"". Come to think of it, every time an admin describes a user's action as ""vandalism"", or a user as a ""vandal"", that's an improper ""personal attack"", according to pschemp's logic. If pschemp treats people equally (not likely), then she better block all the admins who make those ""personal attacks"" of describing a particular user's behavior as ""vandalism"". And she better block Ryulong for using that ""personal attack"" against me in his false edit summaries. "

In favor of merging== Since August 2010, the underground and aboveground Cheongnyangni stations have been directly transferrable through a transfer passageway, contradicting Peterhansen2032's argument. As a rule of thumb, on transferrable stations on the Seoul Subway, the information is combined into one, even for stations with different names (e.g. Isu Station, Cheonan Station). Rather than having to go through a disambiguation page to access information on one of the stations, it would be much more efficient to integrate it into one page for convenient viewing. I support merging. ==

Your a Jew, like most of the peoeple here, obviously there going to say that, thus you are bias in your opinion (and please dont deny it). Why dont you look at it from the Palestinians POV. All practising Jews would believe it is, just like some Jews believe there not doing anything wrong by continously building illegal settlement! Why isnt there a section on that, its been in the news alot, and israel have been condemned for not stopping it, why dont you talk about that! Your a zionist Jew, and a fasicst! Mind the personal attacks, because you were the one that started it, with your ridicilous response! I think there should also be a section, on Israeli propaganda on Net, by Israelis, which by most likely hood would be funded by there degracefull and corrupt leaders. In fact, there should be a section of that also, Corrption. Countless allegations against the heads of states, not a mention!

don't bring controversial issue Hey you seem to bring controversial Bhote issues into fragile Nepali society. Due to people like you and your dirty politics, Nepali communities have many problems. If you really admire Bhotes then why don't you go back to Bhot and help them. Why are you trying to divide Yolmo People. Again Yolmos are not related to Tibetans, only some are. Yolmo are ethnically Nepalis(Gurkhas). Your grandfather might have have come to Nepal to from Bhot, but it doesn't mean you are a true Nepali. Yolmo people have problems because guys like you bring different bhote things in the name of dharma. I think you are a disciple of Shyama Rinpoche. how much money you receive from him to divide Yolmos? Nowadays people like you have fully integrated into Nepal by purchasing lots of property in Nepal, this doesn't mean you are a Nepali. At last you are always a Goo Bhote. So goo bhote bo back to Bhot and worship Shyama rinpoche, drink lots of Bhote tea, tea chauri but please, i beg you don't divide yolmo people of Nepal. and yolmos are nepali and have nothing to do with Bhot. I know you are putting bhote issue into yolmo because you wanted to have the reader feel that yolmos are bhotes.

"==Notability of Nashaa Weiss== A tag has been placed on Nashaa Weiss requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

Don't be stupid. You know, I'm twice as irritated with you as you are with Sheryn. If you don't like her SHUT UP and LEAVE. Wikipedia is no place for mongrels like you. I do not care if you live in Chicago, the UK, or some place, but being totally foolish in Wikipedia is uncalled for. We don't need to know that you find Sheryn's voice sounding like Tuesday Vargas'. Unless you find a news article saying so, then go ahead. I may agree with you regarding incorporating titles here in Wikipedia articles, but just so you know, this is Star Records idea and not her fans'. Don't sound as if you know EVERYTHING about Sheryn. In fact, you don't have any right to edit her article if you don't know her. Just because you see her on TV doesn't mean you know her. In the future, we will develop a more unbiased version of this article, do not worry. As long as QUIT MESSING AROUND WITH THIS VERSION. I am tired of watching behind you and cleaning your crap. Be educated while in Wikipedia's premises.

"Just to put you in the picture, Trident13: the tone is nothing unusual for Dingley. He's got a long history. Being sarcastic/patronizing/abusive/contemptuous makes him feel good. He does it a lot. Funny thing is though, when he decides he's a victim of it he runs, crying like a toddler who's just dropped his ice-cream, to the ""notice board"", demanding people be banned. He's always telling others how to behave, but he doesn't think the rules apply to him. Self-esteem problems. He won't read WP:AGF, of course, because, as you've probably noticed, he already knows everything. Take no notice of the sad fucker. "

By no means are you being an asshole, but I do understand the implications of what you're saying; I just don't agree since every measurement is given on first use. So I'd expect an Australian to understand one of my articles on a pre-metrification Australian ship just fine. Your argument, and that of the MOS itself, has a great deal more merit when no conversions are given so that people can't grasp the scale of things properly. Since my articles can be fully understood by people on both sides of the Imperial/metric scales, I view it more as a matter of taste. And, quite honestly, since I have a large number of FA, A-, and GA-class articles under my belt, most reviewers seem to agree as no one's ever challenged me on this particular point before.

Hi. The image I discussed at the FAC is shown left. The owner allowed me to use it on condition his name was given as copyright holder. Someone at FAC (I can't remember who) suggested it was best not to use it. This photo can probably be deleted. The photo I'm now using was given to me. The photographer sent me the original, full-size master and gave permission to do with it as I want. I am therefore the owner of the image. It's the same when you sell a photo to Getty Images: by agreeing to sell, you relinquish ownership and grant copyright to the purchaser. I was also given a photo of the cannon by Hew Prendergast, great grandson of General Sir Harry Prendergast, the man who defeated Burma in the third Anglo-Burmese war. It was Harry Prendergast who sent the Singora cannon back to England. Hew also said I could use his photo in whatever way I wanted without needing to credit him as the photographer.

The picture on the article is not of the actor T.R. Knight who is the subject of the article. Even a basic Google search turns up pictures of the T.R. Knight about which this article is written. The photo continually being added to the article is, again, not a photo of this article's subject. Because this photo is not relevant to the subject of the article, it should and will be removed. Before my edit or those of others who have made the same edit are reverted, please provide a legitimate reason for this image's inclusion in this article. If a fair-use image of T.R. Knight, the actor and subject of this article, can be found, then by all means it can be added, but random images should not be used as placeholders.

"::::But.. Wikipedia is wisdom of the crowd. See this aricle: For Kendall Whitehouse, senior director of information technology at Wharton, the most interesting question is ""whether the wisdom of the crowd is ultimately a better approach compared to scholarly review and edited content."" As Whitehouse observes, ""Wikipedia's strength is that it has thousands of eyes looking at it. The hope is that errors will be quickly caught and corrected."".. Marketing professor Peter Fader notes that Wikipedia shows there is wisdom in crowds, but a better user rating system would filter out those who post bogus information. Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and public policy, agrees that much of the concern about Wikipedia is just a new spin on whether old media (printed encyclopedias, in this case) stand a chance against the new breed of instantly updatable online media. (quoted from article). In short, no matter what system you come up with here, it is going to be wisdom of the crowd, by design, that is what Wiki is. So you might as well design a system around that concept, go with the natural design of the system, work with it to all its advantages, not work against it and try to limit it with ""old media"" concepts.

Outback / Drinking Urine == Once again, Bear teaches people how to get themselves killed. As Wikipedia's own article on dehydration and the article on human urine notes, drinking urine, like drinking saltwater, does nothing at best, and increases the rate of dehydration at worst. Normal urine contains about 95% water and 5% dissolved solids, much of which is salts. The more dehydrated you are, the higher the percentage of salt in the urine. Your body is only about 1% salt. Water follows a diffusion gradient, so water *leaves* your cells to dilute the urine. The kidneys can pump ions out of your blood to try and lower the salt concentration, but not *that* effectively. Just like drinking seawater to survive is stupid and nearly universally recommended against, you shouldn't survive on urine, either. And here, we're just talking about the salt, let alone the ammonia, nitrates, aldehydes, and other toxins that your body is trying to get rid of. And all of this assumes that it doesn't make you vomit outright and lose even more water. To viewers of the show: don't do it! Of course, we're not allowed to mention anything except for the press release blurbs on the article itself. P ==

Elbutler Elbutler has a habbit of being everybody's friend but will turn on a pin head and stab them in the back if it means becoming friends with admin as she wants to become an administrator for everything and is very power hungry. She always leaves messages on my talk page in order to provoke an attack from me to get me banned which is what she always does on Smallville Wiki as she sucks up to admin to get their approval. See even now on your talk page she abuses knowing full well that i hate that so she wants an attack.

The page you created about yourself has been or will shortly be speedily deleted from Wikipedia, but if you want to use the content from it, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions.

" Excellent points about some of the other very important events in history! Reportedly, Columbus kidnapped a handful of natives and brought them back to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. Whether or not he was abusive toward them aboard ship remains undecided. Some say he was kind to them (according to his journal!) while others say differently. At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

You are addressing none of the points provided and you are dismissing the source provided which says Tatars refers to most Muslim living there. Dutchy are not German, the Lezgis comparison does not make sense, we have already covered this. An ethnic group is defined as such, the link between the Turkic people living there and the Azerbaijani is of ancestry for the Turkic people and Azerbaijani as the product. Both are not the same, they can not be the same, and no article about other peoples which would be neutral will use such a connection. An identity which did not exist at the time can not become existent because you can connect it with an ancestry. This does not make sense; we can then even claim the British and Germans to be the same. You did the same mistake on the Azeris in Turkey, which is basically full of original research how on Earth could Turkic people having moved in what is now Turkey before the identity be considered as Azerbaijanis? From the same token, over half the Turks could be called Azerbaijani. Like you said yourself, we are not going to waste our time, I request a RFC on this article, and do you accept? -

The problem with CT is that in modern times, a relatively small percentage of terroists who are christians are doing terrorism which is explicitly or obviously related to the religion (the most notable exception probably being anti-abortion motivated terrorists) (One could argue that groups like the KKK claim religious motivation as well, but are their type of actions considered religious by the RSs? (honest question) . Conversely, the majority of say islamic terrorists explicitly claim religious reasons for their actions (although other politico-economic issues may be as important if not more important than their ostensible reasoning). (Or one could say that there is a bias in the reporting/research causing this imbalance, but the result is the same as far as wikipedia is concerned) This certainly does not mean one group is better or worse than the other - but just that reliable sourcing on the specific topic of CT is not nearly as available as other religious terror movements.

A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days. This unsourced claim had been challenged and now someone is claiming personal experience as the ""source"" (which would make it original research).

Also, whereas I agree with your description of how material has to be included in WP, I take exception with Michael Johnson's comment above. There are several authoritative scientists who disagree with the mainstream of peer-reviewed papers. The reason why they're not in so far is essentially decided on an interpretation of WP:WEIGHT. As with any rule interpretation, it is liable to be 'soft' and subjective, and this is this interpretation that, good or wrong, has so far been 'applied' by a group of editors. So, there could be a criticism section in this article per WP's rules. Gravity has one. It all comes to how WP:WEIGHT is interpreted, and who interprets it.
Everything in that sentence is stated somewhere else in the realtionships section more clearly, so I'm deleting it. It means that whales(Cetacea) are considered related to the even toed ungulates(Artiodactyla), and hyraxes(Hyracoidea) are considered related to the elephants(Proboscidea) and sea cows(Sirenia). Aardvarks(Tubulidentata) are no longer considered to be related to the anteaters, armadillos, and sloths(Xenarthra). anonymous

" 2008 (UTC) I suppose the entire section is slightly paradoxical, because it deals with the non-technical use of what the article largely treats as a technical term. If someone can find a peer-reviewed statement about who has actually been diagnosed with MDD (which might be a bit of a challenge, given confidentiality laws, so even a peer-reviewed source would probably have to quote the people's own admission to diagnosis), then that'd be great, but for now I've added a footnote in order to reiterate that the section isn't necessarily asserting clinical diagnosis, but rather is listing people who have been at least ""socially"" diagnosed or ""self-diagnosed""which may be what a ""sociocultural aspects"" section needs to do, anyway. I don't know, but hopefully the section should hold water for now, given the minor word changes and the footnotes. 07:29, 1 August"

" imho, activity diagrams are one of the diagrams provided by the UML which is an OMG standard, not related to Utrecht university definition, though it may seem similar on the surface. But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example ""provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling"". To conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism, I suggest we cut it from the text of this page, and maybe just add a ""see also"" pointing to the other page. Cheers."

Don't add material without proper citations A basic rule of Wikipedia is verifiability. When adding new material, please use reliable sources and inline citations. In the case of the InfoBox, if the person is either mentioned in the article as having attained the specific position, or that information exists in their article, in verifiable form, than include it. If not, don't include it.

I've tried leaving it several times but you keep edit conflicting me. The content wasn't invaluable that it needed to be reverted, probably only cited. At any rate here:http://www.the33tv.com/sns-rt-us-shooting-detroit-girltre79405z-20111004,0,5157744.story
" You've earned the condescension I've given you, not because you're wrong, but because you don't have any interest in doing the hard work necessary to become WP:COMPETENT in editing the ID article. This is a technical topic and you're not nearly smart enough to bluff your way through it. If you want to make a contribution here, you're going to have to start reading. Your not understanding the basic issues involved in the Kitzmiller decision tells me you're going to be starting from near-zero. In light of that, I do think your efforts would be best directed elsewhere. tc "

Sorry LeadSongDog but you guys are useless, you don't want to answer to my questions, your arguments are like a broken record, repeating only what you were brainwashed to say. Can you tell me how to report the issue above to your supervisors, or you just dictate and nobody controls you? Thank you, your highness.
" Im cool with it . I don't really agree . As far as what really constitutes immunity like it says about things like reverting vandalism and Restoring removal of sourced material. Also I only wet so far pretty much because I only just learned how to report that stuff just now . However you probably have more experience with that and I done really see any reason to request its removal of my block . If you wanted to I would be cool with it however . Its fine . I got what I needed which was someone to help to curtail the removal of the truth, which is more helpful to others and to see what was/is/has been going on . So thanks for your help . It wasn't a personal attack and if it was or seemed so it wasn't meant to be. I thought there was an automatic notice I didn't know a person had to initiate that . As long as the real truth is there or is debated (on the talk page)until its ""perfect"" Im fine with everything and hope someone keeps an eye on it for vandalism . I really thought because never do this I thought because I was re-adding sourced material. In consensus with the page that there was only like a 5% chance I could be blocked. In favor of the story being correct I took that chance. If you are ""mad"" or whatever and consider it to be a ""personal"" attack it either is or isn't . I say it isn't . I was being ""real"" .You say it is. You probably know more than me about it so Ill go with that . See you out there . Hows that ."
" Ok, so you are then telling the removal of sourced information is absolutely fine on Wikipedia and not vandalism. Does this mean I can highlight all the information in this article, press the backspace button on my keyboard and then get awarded a BarnStar? Makes sense, I'm going to try this magic formula on some articles, thanks for the advice! P.S You are a fucking idiot . "

In modern times, Hindus in Kashmir, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Uganda and Fiji have suffered persecution.

, 21 July 2006 (UTC) Factionists own the article there. No sense trying to edit there anymore. The lawsuit probably has something to do with it. One article only speaks about one publisher of a book that was printed by several, went to court, and had it's copyright voided. The other article is a fake biography written to look sort of credible on top about the other party in the lawsuit (the party that was sued). I wasted too much time messing around with it already; nearly a month. If anyone wants any data on the matter in the future, have them send me an e-mail. Thanks. 13:20

" Criticisms of an Innately Modular Mind Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. My suggestion, is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals, or to add a separate section beneath it titled: ""Criticisms of the Domain-General Model of Mind."" Let us describe EPers fighting their strawmen in a separate section. "

Hello, I'm EmmOmg, I noticed that you recently removed some content describing it as random and adding little substance but not disputing accuracy. I disagree as the the part in question speaks directly to the bio where Sunny Hostin is described as ... a former Assistant US Attorney, as well as a legal expert and TV personality, who is often called upon for her analysis on various provocative issues and high-profile criminal cases in the news. The information speaks to her abilities, case knowledge, quality of opinion and ethical standards displayed during and after a nationally streamed debate on a preeminent legal question. Thus the information is directly on point (not random) as regards legal analysis and adds considerably to readers' understanding of legal bias and ethical standards. Given there is no dispute of the accuracy of the information, the insert should stand.

You are the one attacking and libelling me. I don't follow you around or make a nuisance on your talk page. Learn respect. Slander and libel. Go on and build your evidence, but it's all water under the bridge or over the dam. Cry about spilt milk, but whatever happened is no longer happening and it seems you just want me banned because of your own inconsistent application of the rules. You think that because I prefer going by my IP address, I am some horrible person. I actually leave myself wide open to hackers, so you have little thing to be so upset about. It's my risk here, not yours. Quit complaining.
Please think again about those comments. I'm not an unreasonable guy, nor am I a biased apologist - see WP:NPA, WP:AGF. Also note that I haven't accused you of anti-Mandela bias, nor have I tried to downplay your reference. Nor is it fair to call me discourteous - I contacted you with the reasons I removed your comment, and entered into a discussion. The aim is to establish consensus, which is what I attempted. I've shown enough reason why your original comment was not accurate to say that Mandela has never criticised Mugabe; you've shown that he has indeed been criticised for not saying enough. The only reasonable outcome is to give both sides with references.
Your removal follows your own point-of-view however. Your replacement is not cited, and appears to be essentially your own opinion. So I've restored what Lutyens said.
A question for EJF Why is it you persist in deleting my delete on the page about NOTHING. For a page to be about nothing it must have nothing on it or it is about SOMETHING. Now if you're going to be that much of a boring old git about it perhaps you should spend your time trying to make somebody elses world a little less fun or do you enjoy making things more boring than they could be?
obviously i have clicked the link. but you're being dumb. that is one instance out of about 30 that have happened this morning and i was merely replacing what someone else had written there in the effort that someone like a moderator would notice. now clearly one has, so instead of focussing on the one tiny issue at hand here, why don't you come out from under your rock and take a look at the big picture

" Michael, with all due respect, it's over. It may be that you can do math better than me, but it's not the math that's the problem, it's statements like ""I don't know a whole lot about this case, but I tend to think that race may well be relevant here"" and ""My first instinct is it likely should be included as the news accounts likely included the information. But did they or was this simply not an issue?"". I assume you are ""counting"" those as ""in favour of inclusion""really, one can't. They are not unequivocal inclusion votes and raise more questions than they answer. Moreover, I assume you're including comments like ""I agree that race should be included as long as it does not violate WP:UNDUE."" That's finebut this participant did not address how the inclusion does not violate UNDUE, and since this (as John points out) is not a vote, such a statement can't have the full weight as is carried by the more complete answers of John and Beyond My Ken.

No, no, no. I posted no article, no link. Not even the text I reverted was a link to the article. I made it quite clear that I was reverting vandalism according to policy. If you had been the one deleting it, it would've been one thing, since the policy makes an exception for deleting comments made on one's OWN talk page. But it was another user deleting comments. So it was against policy. If you had bothered to read edit summaries, you'd have seen that I was attempting to revert vandalism, not harass. And now you question my entire purpose here? What is that purpose, and why do you fail to WP:AGF in stating that I have some purpose here other than contributing to the encyclopedia? (Karwynn)
Negative Support for merger. Well logging covers many many more disciplines than electric line. Well logging covers mudlogging, LWD, DST, etc., surely you don't plan on merging those into well logging? Ideally well logging should look something like Well intervention where it gives brief snippets of different well logging methods and links over to them. I think the data in well logging should be merged into the other wikipedia entries. Finally, electric line does not always produce a log. Perforating services and mechanical services, like those used to set plugs, packers, and cement, do not necessarily produce any well logs at all, yet they are very important aspects of wireline operations. Entire wireline companies never produce electric line logs (namely, plug and abandonment companies)

Hungarian names for places before 1867 from another talk page: as the official language of the Kingdom of Hungary was Latin until 1867 , using Hungarian names for cities etc. before this date is anachronistic. Since the Latin name that was used at the time can scarcely be found, we should list all the places with their modern names.

" I agree there's no ""English race"" (indeed there's no such thing as ""biological race""), and I agree that people who identify as English have various mixed ancestries (including ancestries from all continents), but I don't agree that anyone who lives in England in automatically English. I lived in England for five years but I didn't automatically stop being Welsh, and I didn't start to call myself English. Generally English people are people who identify themselves as English and who are identified as English by others, whatever their ancestry. A more specific way to identify English people might be to assert that they must have some belief in a shared common ancestry with other people living in what is now England, though this is a subjective belief because all human groups have a demonstrable close and recent shared ancestry.

We just disagree. By continually insisting that the HelloWorld examples be noted that they only work with Flux is a disservice to the reader.

Merely listing all the factions adds no encyclopedic understanding without some kind of context. Who are they, how are they different, why are they included and not others, what did developer want to do, what did they do, how did players and critics respond, what are the parallels with real world, what are the differences? That is the kind of material WP:WAF expects. And that material is suited for prose. Including some examples is fine, but listing them all (especially in bullet-point form) is unnecessary. At best, a single paragraph could list all of them easily. Gameplay section is already way too long. HELLKNOWZTALK "
We can easily add Beck's POV (perhaps quoting the link I'm reading now that you added to the talk page), but I disagree with your other assertions. In fact I think the article as a whole gives too much credence to the minority viewpoint that Beck is a swell and stable commentator. The introduction, for example , is one of the worst I've read on Wikipedia and it gives absolutely no indication of who this person is and what kind of controversy surrounds him. It appears that, judging by the talk page comments, a small number of editors are enforcing this minority viewpoint on the article through persistence. But I am new to the page, as you know, and this is just my initial impression, so feel free to educate me or otherwise disagree.

" Ray Carver (dart player) My edit to this article is in no way, shape, or form, vandalism. Your favorite thing to do here is to throw away WP links; however, you never seem to understand what they actually are. Quoting from the policy itself: ""Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism.."" Not only is a personal opinion clearly stated as NOT vandalism, but my edit doesn't even fall under the category of ""opinion"". I stated several FACTS, which anyone who knows Ray Carver would confirm. I am a member of the darting community myself, and have played Ray Carver on several occasions, in addition to seeing him play and others, and listening to others views on him. Have YOU done any of this? Do you even know who Ray Carver is? I am tired of your constant tactic of arrogantly deciding what YOU think should or shouldn't be on Wikipedia, quoting policies that you clearly don't understand, and then counting on the quantity of your edits and contributions here to see your way through to ""victory"".

Does really need a Rewrite I want to take up the points about Hegel and dialectical materialism: How is Marxism considered to be at odds with Darwinism? In some Fascistic sense maybe? Marxism is supposed to be about an economic-social science; Darwin about biological science. Marxist teleology is as much political stance as it is analytic, if it even is analytic at all. In fact Marx's precise invocation of Hegel was in order to expunge the latter's idealist teleology and his focus on 'identity' (hence Marx's book 'the Poverty of Philosophy), and then to take synthetic (dialectical) method and apply it to material history. This current article is not only incomplete and limited in its discussion of teleology, but misleading about other topics as well. There is a debate to be had about Marxism and teleology, but this has not been written here.

" Terminology They are substantives derived from the French verb ""tracer"", which normally means ""trace"",[9] or ""trail"" (as in ""he escaped without a trace"").[10] The ""trail"" bit, along with its explanation, doesn't seem to make much sense to me. The verb ""tracer"" is commonly used in French slang to denote fast movement. In the lexicon used in footnote [9], the most accurate definition would be II A 3: ""Marcher vite"", (""walking fast"")and ""filer"" (""to go fast""). This is consistent with most of the synonyms of ""tracer"" that denote movement, such as ""aller trs vite"" or ""courir"" . It ties in with the fact that parkour is described as ""moving around obstacles with speed and efficiency"". And finally, it also corresponds to the article about ""traceur"" on the French site: ""tracer au sens familier de se dplacer vive allure"" 84.92.178.237 "

Dev920 is a sophomore - hence the naive arguments about evidence. What is clear to one person is disputed by someone else (look at how many articles on wiki are 'defended' by fans in denial about their heroes). It is always possible to 'dispute' evidence.

Dev920 - do not vandalize the talk pages. It is childish. Argue in a grown up way. Authoritarian personalities There are users who seek to stifle debate on these pages.

Sorry, but Newton did not have Aspergers syndrome. I friend of mine work as a psychiatrist. She claimed that doctors often say to patients with Aspergers that Einstein or some other brilliant scientist had the condition because it gives them a sense of hope, a sense of pride (many people with Aspergers are often depressed and sometimes even suicidal). If you can prevent them from committing suicide, it will save the doctors alot of paper work and help advance their careers. Genius, creativity and excentricity has absolutely no business associating with autism. Autism is simply a disorder that makes it very hard, if not impossible, for a person with the condition to interact with other people. Since their is no link between high intelligence and autism, the overwhelming majority of people with Aspergers have average IQ.

Please stay cool and keep this in mind while editing. Thank you. Sfacets + + I only state the facts. Sorry. I dictate my External Links edits per Wikipedia's policy. ~ UBeR + Does the policy also cover calling other editors idiots? Comment on the edits, not the editor. Sfacets + I don't believe I ever called you an idiot. If I did, I apologize and will remove it. ~ UBeR + First of all, he did not apologize, second of all, again, he replied to sfacets (who i believe is an administrator) that he is just following wiki policy, no he is not, as simple as that. + Why should I waste any more of my time, the above is black and white.
Poppers image Hi Manatobe, thanks for your message. I suppose my reasons for reverting to the old image were: It's a high quality photo All the bottles are at the same perspective None of the bottles overlap The copyright issues have been resolved (see here).

A tag has been placed on Anthony santamaria, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be a biographical account about a person, group of people, or band, but it does not indicate how or why he/she/they is/are notable. If you can indicate why Anthony santamaria is really notable, I advise you to edit the article promptly, and also put a note on Talk:Anthony santamaria. Any admin should check for such edits before deleting the article. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. Please read our criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 7 under Articles. You might also want to read our general biography criteria. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself. To contest the tagging and request that admins should wait a while for you to assert his/her/their notability, please affix the template to the page, and then immediately add such an assertion. It is also a very good idea to add citations from reliable sources to ensure that your article will be verifiable.

See on Becher and various other pieces of original research on the Web. It seems likely to me that Becher had plenty of local recognition as a military leader, but no status in the eyes of London. There is further Pollard's suggestion that Thomond took over from 1605. More likely Brouncker had the nominal title, but had made such a bad job of the position that he had little power on the ground. The article should reflect the reliable sources, naturally.

"::::::::: The problem here is that NYT won't retract an article that the vast majority of the public sees as ""combating evil pedophiles"", so no such retraction will ever happen, no matter the evidence against Eichenwald's veracity. This was a relevant article in NYT a couple of years ago and they're not about to touch it again, even in light of new information. I think that we, as Wikipedia editors, can do a better job of remaining consistent with current data than traditional newspapers can, and this is a perfect example of an opportunity to do so. You know as well as I do, that in a time when there's real news happening all over the world, NYT will not bother incorporating this new information in a retraction, but we can. I think most people involved in this discussion want this article to be accurate, myself included, and given the recently-exposed questionability of Eichenwald's credibility, from fairly reliable sources, we need to give that data some serious reconsideration, even if NYT doesn't consider it worthy of a retraction.

Hi Can I ask why you are naming people who aren't me (JohnJoe) as socks of mine? I mean, my real sock, who is a very active user here, is no way associated with any of the users associated with me. In fact, I haven't 'socked up' against you since by banning for raising legitimate objections against your conduct. Oh, and I expect this comment to be removed, dodging the question and perpetuating a fued that could have been ended months and months ago.

" The British National Front was and is 'far-right', yes? Let's not whitewash in this article. In putting the term 'far right' before 'National Front', and removing the uncited last line that appears to promote Griffin (""Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."") I have been reverted and accused of 'vandalism' by a regular editor here, User:Parrot of Doom. I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as ""a far right and whites-only party"" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal. Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me. We need to do some work here people, and pull together some references: there are plenty in Nick Griffins case! "

Support As a practicioner who has used IDEF in the past, that is how I would search for it and I would refer to it.

I would place the level at below 5% for IDEF. I think this Google Trends page illustrates this point nicely.
Beginning with your first edit, every talk page entry you have created seems to be full of arguments and vitriol. You seem to lack the ability to cooperate and work with others.

":I don't want to be judging other users, especially since I was recently blocked and unblocked for a slight offense over 3RR, but I've found it incredibly difficult to collaborate with this user here when editing the 2008 South Ossetia article. The user's purpose on Wikipedia seems to be inserting a certain anti-Russian POV (and calling everything he disagrees with ""Russian propaganda"") in related articles, disregarding some of the most fundamental procedures and edit warring, blanking pages to remove things he doesn't want people to see, gaming the system to push his POV, and acting in an incredibly hostile fashion to any user who does not agree with him. Again, this is not an accusation or a judgment on the user, but a personal opinion. In conclusion, the user has not been constructive at all, so I'm surprised the admins reduced his block for a repeated offense. Nonetheless, my best wishes to the user and I hope he refrains from making more unnecessary attacks in his edits and edit summaries. "

citing sources Hi. I'm just wondering, in regards to citing sources, is it normal to have multiple references listed, even if they are the same, or is there some way of combining all the identical references into one? for example, on some references I see a,b,c,d,e listed across, but I'm not sure how to do that. Sorry for bothering you, it's just that I'm really confused about all this. Thanks

" In this instance I don't believe there is much potential for conflict of interest. First, none of the surgeon's themselves appear in involved in the creation or maintenance of this page. Second, the page provides basic general information. Third, most of the well known practitioners are listed and provided in alphabetical order. Fourth, the listed surgeons are hardly in need of ""extra"" business, since of all them have quite long waiting lists. Fifth, their potential patients are generally internet connected and quite likely to utilize searches to locate informaton about them. Sixth, given the nature of this particular type of surgery, and the generous people who perform it often at risk of criticism from some biased groups, should not be hidden from view or made to appear marginalized in any way.

Because it's a redlink farm, has a very low number of incoming links (only 3 from article space, 1 of which is an article about his company), and no strong assertion of notability. , and I'll hold off on any action for now. Persuade me he's notable and I won't even trouble us all with a nomination -) (or indeed myself with having to do some serious research) One of the good things about thye deletion process is how often it leads to very positive action, such as the improvements of articles, the starting of new cleanup initiatives, etc. I've plenty of evidence of these on my talk pages. Perhaps this can be such a case. I'm more concerned about Dragon Door. Any chance you could merge? In my experience, most deletion nominations are emphatically not discussed first. I don't know why (time, maybe, as most are janitorial actions) - perhaps they should be - but generally they aren't.

joshbuddy, it is your opinion that I do not know how to work with others. I appreciate this is your feeling, and I am glad you felt free to share it with me. What is amazing in this exchange is that you view critical and studied analysis as hostility. I have not offered any insults. I have offered objective feedback, and explanations when asked for. When you write that I completely missed the existence of the HLC and HIS your statement is purely absurd! I am the one that added that language in the introduction in the first place! Frankly, EVERY SINGLE item you complain I omitted is in fact FOUND in the verified version! How on earth you can claim to have a meaningful analysis comparing the verified Lead-in language with the body of the article is beside me to understand. I recommend continued education as a remedy.

BBC One ident images - fair use Many thanks for your message Orphaned fair use image (Image:BBC One Capoeira Wales.jpg). I originally re-uploaded both Image:BBC One Capoeira Wales.jpg and Image:BBC One Capoeira.jpg, previously used (if I recall correctly) in BBC television idents and BBC 'Rhythm & Movement' idents, when I noticed a spelling error made by the original uploader in the names of both images. I uploaded the images again with their current names and nominated the originals for deletion. This was purely to make finding these images using the search facility easier. I fully support your work on the aforementioned articles (see my comment here) and understand why this image does not meet the specified criteria. If one or both of these images are no longer required or allowed as a result, I am happy for them to be removed. Thanks again.

" YOU Listen, you're just like every other forum mod and admin out there. In real life, you're probably just some typical, anonymous 9-5 jobber. And you make up for your lack of authority by becoming a big shot on the internet. You leave me condescending messages in which you refer to me as ""son"" and accuse my accurate information of being ""vandalism"". Well just because you have the time and inclination to join pathetic like ""Wiki Wrestling Project"" which unfortunately affords you more privileges than me, doesn't make you better. You denied me my right to post relevent and pertinent trivia on the page in favor of templates and interfaces. You are a disgrace to Wikipedia and I will be reporting you for your ham-fisted authority and hypocritical ways (accusing me of personal insults yet referring to me as 'son'.)"

You are an extremely biased admin. I am amazed you got this position. You have been very active to support Hindu editors in edit wars by not taking any action when they were engaged in edit wars. You yourself should be blocked for violating 3RR rule in Iqbal. Even your nickname is a symbol of Hindu imperialism and POV pushing. You are the one of the worst violators of Wikipedia policies. It is not your position to block any user.

Congratulations Your harassment and persecution of has caused far more damage and far more widespread damage to Wikipedia than her highly localized abrasiveness aver could have. You make me sick to my stomach, whoever you are and whatever your motivations might be. You have caused an odious stench which will be impossible to erase.

Words to Watch Slim and I are ready to take it live, pending any tweaks you want to make beforehand. It strikes me there are two basic ways to bring it online: Directly replacing the text of the existing Words to avoid page, followed after !brief discussion by a retitling to Words to watch. As Words to watch, arguing from there that it should supplant Words to avoid. The latter would be more politic; the former is certainly more efficient. Thoughts?

Because in the caption it says ""With technical support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)"" and its source stated as ""Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO)"". How ever I couldn't find any such publication at the FAO publications, furthermore it does resmble the structure of any of the other offcial publications there. All refernces to it, directed at UNISPAL(UN Information System on the Question of Palestine)So I am quesitoning its validity, is it an officail publication by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.(might make sense as it only discuss and base its conclusion on the Agriculture aspects). If so why would this document from 2010, by the Food and Agriculture, rerpresented as the UN official position, considering that in 2011 an official publication from the UN Secretary-General's Panel of Inquiry stated it is legal.UN publication.

I thought about those things, but I am relatively inexperienced at wiki, wasn't sure how to change the title or move, and since I did not create the article, I did not want to destroy someone else's work.

Why delete my original submission, I thought this site was for people to edit with constructive points?
" I've tried to explain to you problems with statements like ""all mainstream jewish groups oppose jews for jesus"". If you can't understand this I'm not sure where else this can go. Perhaps you might benefit from visiting the talk page off WP:NPOV and some other editor can explain why this is not permissibile at wiki. Their are indeed many pov-pushing elements to this page. Things like the gigantic ""Christianity"" template used to ""warn"" people abot this group. As far as the blockquote, the combination of footnotes and poor writing seemed to indicate it wasn't a quote. It isn't appropriate to insert footnotes into someone else's quote if he wants he'll create his own footnotes. Cleaning up someone else's writing isn't POV. The citation itself is a rewriting of the j4j belief statement. And in this case, it is necessary: no self-respecting professional would use a phrase like ""basically indistibuishable"". "
OS, you're welcome to edit here if you make constructive edits to articles within our policies, Whoever wrote this: My contribution here is extremely constructive. Apart from my work in the three pages that I tried to edit and was constantly censored, I point out to the abuses that take place here by some administrators. My contribution is very constructive because it calls for accountability. There is abuse going on here. I have pointed out to those abuses. If you dont want anyone rocking the boat then you dont like me. But if you really care to set things straight and make Wikipedia a fair and unbiased encyclopaedia where both opposing views are treated with the same consideration then I am the right person here and my contribution are extremely valuable. It all depends what is most important to you. If you want to have a good encyclopaedia then my criticism of these abuses are very helpful. If all you care is to have a groupie of people who would do whatever they want and if someone complains they ban him then obviously I am in the wrong place.

I am certainly not the only person who has written data at the Greg Leon page (and you should also see the Leon talk page), but I shall give your words some thought, for what it is worth. If I edit it again, it will be with what you've written above in mind...though I can't guarantee I'll agree with you fully...Also, not every page at Wikipedia uses the exact same citation format. Many include references for general data without specifying which reference a particular quote came from, especially if information is paraphrased. At the same time, please respect that I am interested in MC and the information that has been added by me to their page is not POV but is detail found at Chronological Crue and many other MC sites and bios...so please don't rush to continue our unfortunate tit-for-tat on their page. Remember that I conceded that Leon was never a member of MC and ceased that particular edit...
priceless. I hate that guy
ChillyMD - which curricula you have looked at and why are they not equivalent? The accredited North American schools have anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, and all the same basic sciences as traditional medical schools, which are then tested on a board exam. The only arguable difference is residency, which is not required, but is rapidly expanding and may become a requirement in the future. The same, no, equivalent, yes.
You've been warned before - please stop. (t) 17:57, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

"::Addendum: I think I may have found the source of the confusion. Within the medical establishment, a medical student who has not yet received his or her MD is referred to as an ""undergraduate"", in contrast with residents who've received their MDs but are not yet board-certified. In that context, a medical student is an ""undergraduate"" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program. However, that does not mean that an MD is an ""undergraduate degree"" as that term is usually understood in the US. That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a ""graduate program"", and the degrees it grants are ""graduate degrees"". I think that the current wording is adequate to avoid this confusion. It's worth noting that in practice, it's extremely rare to find a medical student in the US who doesn't already have a degree from a four-year college. My wife's a medical student, and every one of her classmates has a BS or BA. (talk contribs) "

For the last time, Turkish people ARE NOT WHITE. Racially, religiously, ethnically, traditionally, and historically, they are not european. Therefore, they are not white. Even their DNA does not classify them as a white people. They are on asia minor, NOT europe. Reading back your posts, you seem to be stubborn in thinking that middle eastern people are white. Why is that? Are you turkish or middle eastern? I really do not understand why you are so persistant in this matter when it is heavily documented that turks are not white.

Many tasks on wikipedia require much less thought than article creation, so it would be unreasonable for him to have to check every single article if using AWB to stub sort a category for example.

Perhaps Ser Amantio is afraid that if his AWB is restored he'll have people moaning at him about quickly tagging talk pages or something...

Thank you for the heads up, . earlier sent me a private mail requesting my help before this was moved to main space and I helped him to re-write the introduction section. I also pointed out to him in more detail what is missing in the article (neutral point of view, nonjudgmental language, opposing views). I spent several minutes to highlight these problems and how they can address it. I decided not to fix it myself because I believe the best way editors can learn is to allow them to do things themselves and then we can help to fix minor problems. Doing this we make them a better Wikipedian. I advised Olaniyan not to move this to main space until the issues are addressed but I'm perplexed and disappointed to see that he actually moved the article to mainspace without addressing the problems. I expect Olaniyan to fix these problems today per my earlier suggestions and they are free to also contact other editors for advice. I will be glad to move the page back to their sandbox, if they choose not to fix the problems today. t@lk to M

" Your donation will fund Wikia, Inc., which is not a charity. Your non-profit donation will ultimately line the for-profit pockets of Jimmy Wales, Amazon, Google, the Bessemer Partners, and other corporate beneficiaries. How? Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc. Its co-founder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine! Now here is the really fascinating thing. If you go to Jimmy Wales' ""talk page"" on Wikipedia, and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his for-profit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or self-dealing, Jimbo won't even have time to respond. One or two of his sycophants will fairly promptly dismiss or erase your message; and if you try one more time to ask this question, you're likely to get blocked from editing Wikipedia altogether.

Consensus can indeed change, but it isn't going to in this case. Olbermann went to Cornell, and that's that.

Motot constant Found this at http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brushless_DC_electric_motor&diff;=483432978&oldid;=483432770 == KM rating == ''KM'' is the ''motor constant'' (sometimes, ''motor size constant''), defined as: :\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{P}} where * \scriptstyle \tau is the motor torque (SI units, Nm) * \scriptstyle P is the resistive power loss (SI units, W) The motor constant is winding independent (as long as the same conductive material used for wires); e.g., winding a motor with 6 turns with 2 parallel wires instead of 12 turns single wire will double the velocity constant, Kv, but KM remains unchanged. KM can be used for selecting the size of a motor to use in an application. Kv can be used for selecting the winding to use in the motor./ It look to me as if the scope is well beyond the original article and if put anywhere - it should be herer.

I saw Beware the Night and realized that the date has been pushed back to 2014, I was acting frivolously and I apologize. Before I began editing Sean Harris' page, it consisted of nothing more than a few paragraphs of information, and I took the liberty of giving him a table featuring his film and TV work. I never meant to be a bully, but those hidden messages were out of line, and were not directed to the edits concerning his early short films. I reverted them because I didn't find them on IMDB, but now I realize I am in the wrong and I apologize dearly.

Complete decapitation was considered a grave dishonor and disgrace."" Reason: there is nothing to substantiate this at all. The only thing I have come across that suggests that leaving a piece of skin was at once considered ""ideal"" is from the Hagakure, and even there it was not a matter of disgrace. In fact, in the Hagakure, Yamamoto Tsunetomo advocates cutting all the way through - better to do the job properly than risking botching the job: ""In the practice of past times, there were instances when the head flew off. It was said that it was best to cut leaving a little skin remaining so that it doesn't fly off in the direction of the verifying officials. However, at present it is best to cut clean through."" Of course, the notion that a 10 lb head should go ""flying off"" (presumeably from the blood pressure) is absurd. This was likely just an urban legend back in the day in Japan."

The son of the first unofficially recognized titular monarch of the Blaskets since the ""great departure (when the indigenous inhabitants left the islands)?"" King Richard is just a King as the former King of Greece or just as Royal as the Princes of Russia or Germany. His Majesty DID NOT say that illegitimate German Nobility inherited titles. He simply said that Prince Albert's new title of Count de Grimaldi would be inherited to his descendents just as the titles of the former Royal and Noble German States; equal inheritance, which means (in case you did not know) that ALL children of a Count would gain the style of Count or Countess. That's all His Majesty was saying; NOTHING more. Everything else you said was pure ""make-believe"" (on your part). When we look at articles of FORMER Royalty or Nobility, or their descendents, such as you say are nt ""real,"" do we not see their ""not real"" titles listed as their titles? I see no difference with Countess Jazmin Grace Grimaldi de Grimaldi. Her title SHOULD be listed on her page, due to the fact that even though King Richard is not the King of a country, he has the right to grant titles of Nobility; granted that the titles are TITULAR, they ARE real. 04:57"

HI JohnHistory Yes, you will be blocked and your thoughtful post here deleted by someone like Tarc. The main thing to realize is that Wikipedia has always been, and will always be, a clusterfuck. If you're interested in finding out detailed histories of the lives of anime characters, it's a start, but other than that, it's virtual pages are only good for wiping virtual shit out of your virtual asshole. This place attracts the worst kind of assholes, and it's hard to trust in the good faith of something from which nothing but shit and hot air spews forth. They decide what a proper source is, they decide what's been discussed in the media, just like they decide which place in SF has the best glory holes. Any type of internet arrangement with a hierarchy attracts the worst type of vaginal discharge. Wikipedia's political content is governed by a bunch of aborted leftists who read a couple of pages of Das Kapital, decided it was nice and then put it down. They are a bunch of fucking cocksuckers, literally and figuratively.
Take it from a history major: a bachelor's degree in history = Bachelor of Arts, or a BA in History. The same would be true for people who majored in English, political science, philosophy, etc. If you major in chemistry, biology, physics, etc., you would receive a BS, or Bachelor of Science. Finally, if you major in art, theater, film, dance or something like that, you would receive a BFA, or Bachelor of Fine Arts.

He assumed that I did not read his warning, and did not like my defiance. I asked him ""who are them""? Then, I immediately got blocked. So I'm requesting for unblock.

Incorrect info Following the move, the college began to offer a number of Theology and Education degrees which were validated by the Council for National Academic Awards (the CNAA). When this was scrapped following the 1992 Education Act, the college entered an academic partnership with the University of Oxford allowing Westminster students to read for degrees of the University. NOTE: This is not correct. Degrees were those of the University of Oxford until, in what many people felt was a singularly ill-judged action, Westminster parted from the University of Oxford. After that, the degrees were validated by the CNAA until the union with Oxford Brookes. Further, academic subjects while linked with Oxford University were far wider than simply Theology and Education. 220.255.2.100

":::It might sound plausible, yet it doesn't explain the step of being expelled from Wikipedia. This unrelated revert triggered the expulsion yet it doesn't have anything to do with AN/I and I will prove it on your talk page. It was a hasty action to block someone just because he rightfully reverted the disruptive edits of one user who previously has partaken in multiple disputes over the same thing - genres in the infobox. I find it quite ironic that no one seemed to notice that these exaggerated responses are clearly-obviously-not-to-be-taken-seriously which some unrelated users reduced to ""vicious personal attacks/borderline threatening"". This was used as an excuse to make the final step. Also it's quite shocking that AN/I is treated like pub where everyone can influence others' opinions. "

" Episcopal High School Sorry about my addition. I recognize that the ""drug use"" section was unneeded, and I added that before I recieved your message. But the section TAB""Recently, the reign of Episcopal has begun a slight decline. The first sign of this was the new Episcopal code: ""Episcopal students do not lie, cheat, steal, or chew gum on campus."" This was taken to be a joke by many students, but alas, it was not. Additionally, several excellent teachers have left, and recently one of most notable faculty, Holocaust Historian John Iorii, has been asked not to renew his contract. These changes in the EHS experience began with the choice of former headmaster Charlie Zimmer to abdicate his title to Dale Regan. When asked about Ms. Regan, one student was quoted as saying, ""She seems to me to be a Neo-Facist, and she talks entirely too slow."" is an actual even that is happening at the school. This something that is just as worthy as being on the page as the noose section is. If you do not think the line ""When asked about Ms. Regan, one student was quoted as saying, ""She seems to me to be a Neo-Facist, and she talks entirely too slow."" is uncalled for, that is fine, it can be removed if neccessary."
Done some checking, it looks like this is going to end up as a range cite with a note at the end, because different sources are claiming different speeds. The official total seems to vary between 32 and 33 knots, the mathematical formula gives the speed at 34.9 knots, and the user requesting the cite has information stating 31 knots. I'm heading for the library tomorrow in hopes of finding some kind of info on what the USN considered the official speed to be, but if I fail I think that the section will need a reword to account for this discrepancy.

Don't give me the bullshit about sockpuppets either, you said IF YOU VANDALISE WIKIPEDIA AGAIN AS YOU '''DID TO DEEP PURPLE you will be blocked immetidely. (cant spell that.)

Wikipedia in general Honestly, you take this too seriously. It's just the fucking internet you twats. Getting all annoyed and faffing on with blocking and reverting edits and the like. Maintaining Wikipedia is a fucking joke.
I don't think there is anything cynical about it Unfortunately, I suspect I'm being realistic, not cynical. As, apparently, paid editing is the new accepted norm on Wikipedia, editors who are interested in improving the encyclopedia without taking payment will be forced out - cetainly anyone who expreses any opinion other than complete acceptance seems to be shouted down very vigorously by its proponents. In addition, being attacked for having the nerve to try to improve an article found during a CCI clean-up, being told that I should not edit anywhere on Wikipedia because I referred to redacted instead of redacted for a British Naval Base in Northern Ireland, does not improve my mood.
" stop stupid acusations I find it unacceptable to delete peoples contribution without any comments. I have now been repeated acused of writing a long rant while all my modifications thereof have been reverted. There is no OFFICIAL evidence incriminating Osama as the eavil doer. This reenforces why all acusations of muslim terrorist attack should have proper quotation. If you lack such sources (which I claim you do) we do not need your opinion to provide the rest of reality. Your lies as ""the truth"" here in wikipedia The suggestion there would be sufficient proof or even mainsteam consensus about the event is a clear lie. I personally find it unimaginable that wikipedia has a page where Muslim Extremists are claimed to be the cause leaving no room for any sensible explaination. no referrences to Obstruction of justice huh? The article should clearly mention the great effort the Bush administration made of hiding all the evidence. This was the main embodyment of the attack. Obstruction of justice of this scale is a far bigger crime as murder. FOLLOW THE MONEY! The page should mention Lary Silverstein owned the building for a day and a half and maxed out the insurance for multiple terrorist attacks. Thus he cashed in multiple times. the muslim extreamist terrorists label kit A discussion about using the word Terrorist seems to provide an interesting vessle to obstruct the discussion. It has repeatedly been made clear the word terrorist attack can be used to explain the event but there is no ground to keep calling those who staged the event muslim extreamist terrorists."

Yes, there was criticism in the article, suggesting evaporation as the source of the thurst. However, it was (together with all criticisms) removed/censored by POV pushing editors. No control for mass was done in either experiment, and evaporation of order of less than microgram per second could easily explain the effect (especially in the NASA case); even more so, if there is some moisture. What you are essentially doing, is microwaving the interior of a cone, and - surprise surprise - there is a small force in the opposite direction. Then you turn off the heating, but your interior is still at higher temperature, measure it again, and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that. Also, some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure, even in chamber?! according to brief paper), so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However, in vacuum, ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed, beats me. 213.198.221.171

" All these points are very interesting and worthy of study and thought, but these points also remain: Jews remind themselves every year ""Slaves were we in Egypt,"" and no real Jews would ever say: ""We are children of Abraham and we were never enslaved."" The Synoptics contain several references to tax collectors and John not a single one. Josephus indeed does not say who was the leader of the great Jewish protest in Caesarea, and rather gives the impression that it was spontaneous and acephalous, but this is rather hard to believe. A brief mention of the Crucifixion of Jesus by Pilate follows, which may or may not be a useful hint. Besides the tax collectors, John also omits the Baptism of Jesus, the Temptation, the Transfiguration, the Kiss of Judas, the Tears of Peter, the institution of the Eucharist, etc. Roman historians are just as bad as the Gospel writers when it comes to confusing Procurators and Prefects. The archaeological evidence says that Pilate was a Prefect, but both Tacitus and the Gospels call him a Procurator, just to confuse us, perhaps. Das Baz, 18 April 2006, 10:51 AM."

"suck it asshats Hurricane Expert Reconsiders Global Warming Link Prominent MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel has publicly reversed his view regarding global warming's alleged impact on hurricanes. The [computer] models are telling us something quite different from what nature seems to be telling us,"" said Emanuel, whose views on hurricanes and global warming have been prominently cited by Al Gore and other promoters of climate change fear. He told the New York Times. ""There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing. Hard to know which to believe yet. In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming. His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. ""First, 2007 turned out to be the tipping point for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears. Now another major scientist reconsiders his views on a significant aspect of man-made climate fears. "

I couldnt find in the BBC article the emphasis you put on the material here at all. is that because I'm missing something or is it your POV editing? the article says everyone walked off in solidarity with the Xtians and as far as I could see didnt say they stopped participating full stop at all Why do you attribute those edits to me? because in the edit history it isnt there after you edited on 2 march and then it is there after you edited on 4 march. still, a revealing answer in its way i guess. says it all Read whatever you want into it, who cares, seems I must have mixed up different articles or something, it was months ago. i read into it you are a liar and a twister for your POV - you got 'mixed up' - yeah right. fuck off. This is my talk page, so I think you're the one who needs to ""fuck off"". =="
", 25 July 2012 (UTC) And I'm sure you left a warning to the guy who made a false accusation of vandalism. Ah, but of course you didn't, because the use of the word ""fuck"" will upset all the kiddies but dishonest accusations of vandalism are not just tolerated but encouraged. If you can't see anything wrong with fucking morons too stupid to even understand what vandalism is being given free reign to piss off anyone they like, then you're a fucking stupid cunt as well. 190.44.158.38 23:15"

" October 2011 (UTC) Hi Tom, I understand and you don't have to convince me of the similarities, it's just that WP requires citations to reliable sources, in this case where the author of a book or a music paper article or a professional website like AllMusic has made the connection. So those examples above, though worthwhile in themselves, don't solve the 'citation needed' issue. However I'm sure I've seen the ""Mona"" / ""How Soon Is Now"" connection made in at least one book on The Smiths so let me scout around and see if I can find it. Take care and tks for stopping by to discuss. Cheers, 03:20, 20"

Ceiling fan article - vandalism Yo dude, heads upmore vandalizing had been done by 67.43.101.138 to the ceiling fan article. I've reverted certain portions of his edits, and left a lengthy explanation and warning on his talk page (as I saw that you had done twice before), which I think you should read.

" Yeah, seriously, what is up with the whole ""barnstar"" giving thing? All the barnstars I've ever received are on my user page, all seven of them (actually I've received about two more but I just refused to put those up because they were, essentially, given by the barnstar-giving cabal). I've been here for two and a half years (since 12/19/05) and have seven while these users have several dozen in 3-4 months? I'm not saying that I want a ton of barnstars, I'm just saying that they lose all ""value"" lately. The barnstars I received (and other ""old farts"" too) have been for significant work like the checkuser investigation I dug up or the massive clean-up I did on a bunch of articles that Redvers found. Today, though, it appears that a barnstar is just because you're a ""Wikifriend"" of another user. *Shrug* "

Materialscientist is a racist Seriously, fuck you man.

References/Reflist Regarding the most trivial thing ever, I've noticed you some time change the references/ tag to reflist. The style guideline suggests references/ should be used when there are ten or less, and reflist when there are ten of more.

You have been blocked indefinitely from editing for edit warring in information after being warned the information was unreliable. Edit warring is bad even if you are adding correct information, but when you are adding information you have been warned about multiple times it's even worse.

Yet, here you are, edit-warring in information from the United World Chart and from madonna-charts.com, both of which are listed. Any admin can unblock when this editor agrees to stop edit-warring and to pay attention to chart sourcing guidelines.

" There is nothing irrelevent about the argument about the crediblity of the investigation, prosecution, or outcome of this case; in face, that argument about the credibility is itself a major part of this story. Whether one chooses to believe it or not, there are a lot of inconsistencies with the method of investigation (enough so that part of Amanda's interrogation was thrown out by the Italian Supreme Court), prosecution (the prosecution admitted that they believed Amanda was guilty early on simply because of her ""behavior"" http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20000577-504083.html, the prosecution DID admit to withholding key evidence against Raffale Sollecito (the bra clasp, halting the trial for a month)and the outcome (it is a fact that the judge took cell phone calls and members of the jury fell asleep during the defense portion of the trial. These are facts. The purpose of Wikipedia is to tell the entire story, not just the part that is convenient. People above are correct this is not the forum to debate the trial, but it IS the forum to define the trial. The trial definitely has in consistencies and that needs to be narrated. You don't have to agree to it, but you do have to allow it. If not, it is the editors here who are using Wikipedia as an incorrect venue to be a forum of pro-guilt only."

Rockford First Hey Jim, I am on the home stretch ( or so I hope) to getting the site up and running. I was able to get a few pictures that I have from our church archives. I am having a few issues with Wiki commmons. However, as soon as I get them licensed and such I will get it all figured out. Could you do a thorough proofing of the article again to see what I could change to make it better. I have tried to keep neutral and just informational. Let me know! Thank you so much!
Jews have the right to expel Arab invaders from their homeland. Those who believe Jewish ancestral land belongs to these Arab invaders are typical Nazi propagandists.
The figure might include a few Israelis killed while in the West Bank or Gaza but majority of them are most definetly settlers. As a matter of fact all these people are known by name and how they were killed so we can count exactly how many of them were settlers (a number that undoubtedly exceeds 200). Also you must note that there is not a single part of the article that even mentions the violence by settlers against Palestinians. Not to forget the rocket attacks, OK it's true they are on much smaller amounths than the rocket attacks by Hamas on Israel but they are still worth mentioning considering they are being done and with intent to kill civilians.
Tiptoety your judgemts seems to consits of he;s been blocked before, so must be guilty. That indicates a very dull mind.
Also, you don't need to scream at be with bold letters. I stopped doing when I realized how it affected other editors. You are still doing it.
Update: another user did THE SAME revert back to the status quo and added the compromise, much like I intended to with the last revert when I noticed I am blocked. This block is extremely unfair and completely unjustified. Too bad he missed the obvious vandalism and suppression of information here

" It is a pointy edit because you are removing information not because you believe it not to be factual, but to make a point, that if you're not allowed to add material without a citation from a reliable source when another editor disputes it, then everything must be sourced. If you were removing it because you actually did not believe that the Tappan Zee Bridge connects Greenburgh to Orangetown, then the edit would not be pointy, but you're only doing it to make a point about ""consistency"" - and that is the very definition of pointy editing. Cut it out, please. "
Thank you, this was helpful. Obviously this is an issue I struggle with. I'm a California boy BTW. And I agree about the quotes, they are troubling. I'd like to see them disallowed, as they are commonly used to promote fringe opinions and/or as a backdoor method for expressing one's personal judgments, and since most people ignore fringe remarks, there are usually not countervailing opinions available for quotation.

" UN Security Council ""The human rights enshrined in the UDHR, the Geneva Conventions and the various enforced treaties of the United Nations are theoretically enforceable in law. In practice, many rights are are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them. None of the above have reliable sources. Nothing is ""theoretically"" enforcable. The UNSC MAY enforce anything that is wants to. The problem (from your pov) is that it doesn't want to. You are presuming that human rights violations are ignored (and I agree), but how did you and I determine that there were violations? Neither of us may do this for WP? My Translation: You hold strong opinions about human rights and the failure of the UN and national authorities to enforce your opinions''. We likely mostly agree on this. Our opinions, and those of commentators are merely opinions. The law is what the UNSC says that it is. Am I missing something here? "
Fuck your propaganda! What we need is an unbiased look at this. The soviet soldiers saved the estonians from Nazism, and the estonisans are not bitching about this.

Real good article, but the tone seems to demonize the demonizers!! I would start out by saying that all human beings have both good and evil characteristics, while demons are just evil. Also, the need to demonize is shown in warfare where you must make your enemy evil in order to happily kill him.

There's no conflict, a court martial can end with other sanctions and the party demoted in rank as Whitman was. The court martial did effect his views on the Marines as his diary shows. At the time of his discharge, it was his wishes and for the convenience of the Marines, according to the records. The Marines gave him an honorable discharge. Of course this is unverifiable even though I have all of the Marine Records, FBI records, Medical Records, Police Records, Texas Department of Public Safety Records, interviews with Whitman's professors, friends, victims and a few members who were in his Boy Scout Troop when he was a Scout Master in Austin. So I am not qualified to speak on Whitman in the article as the history on the article page will show. Also, my interviews with Martinez and McCoy are audio, so they can't be used either because of WP:COI and verifiability, even though my name is used in a few of the sources in the article on Whitman. Hope this helps with your contradiction concerns. Cheers! 98.94.146.83

I have doubts about the notabilty of this organization. It is mentioned in the article on Spix Macaw several times, and I asked, what is this organization? The original wikilink (probably an unintentional typo) pointed to the town of Lymington, England, so I de-wikified it. The Lymington Foundation is a bird conservation organization in State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. It's also the name of a much larger charity, which is not associated with the conservation organization. The Lymington Foundation is associated with Spix Macaw, a flagship nearly extinct bird. They have international connections to Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation, Loro Parque, Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots, and World Parrot Trust Their website is apparently http://www.pipress.org/2009/11/the-lymington-foundation/. There's not a lot of press about it - it's a family foundation. Maybe it's too local an organization? I'm going to stop here until I get some feed back. I've placed the name in the Lymington disambiguation section, where it has a dead(red) link. In that way, its similar to the names of many obscure biological species without separate articles. Anybody?

I really don't want to see either of you (you or andromedean) getting blocked, so i have an off an/i sollution. and i don't clame to have any special status, i'm just a concirned editor who has seen many cases like this. but for a little while, maybe both you and andromedean need to stay away from that particular article untill things simmer down between you two. this coming from someone who's aunty is a counceler. trust me S&P;, i don't want to see either of you getting blocked, so please think about the idea of both of you staying away from the article temperarily, or at least stay away from each other for a short while untill things cool down, ok? 199.101.61.190

Essentially this list makes no sense. Instead of scouring the net for that one silly article that will drop the emo buzzword in reference to a band that has nothing to do with it (that's what is going on in some cases), shouldn't this be relying on more of a consensus for whether or not a band is emo? You may find one article to call AFI emo, but for every one of those, you can find hundreds that wouldn't dare throw them into that. That doesn't mean the consensus is right 100% of the time, but there's something wrong with the idea of trying to find one person dumb enough to call a band emo so they can be included on some list.
Speculation by members of an internet newsgroup such as rec.heraldry cannot in any way be considered as reliable information.

First off, I am not inserting my personal point of view just the facts. I don't know where you got your facts from but they are incorrect. As a life long resident of Miller, having both parents from Miller I am well aware of the boundaries of Miller. and your account is false... Also, I am not talking of this ORIGINAL TOWN of Miller or is supposed boundaries but The Miller Beach Area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call Miller Beach a Neighborhood of Gary makes the very notion of Miller smaller than it really is... I don't have agenda here. I just don't want my home town slighted by mis-information. It is the word Neighborhood that is of issue. Miller Beach has several Neighborhoods... It was settled almost 100 years before Gary was established. It is town that has been annexed. It is not a neighborhood of Gary. It existed before Gary. These are historical facts. Is Miller under the municipal control of the City of Gary? YES...Is it an area within the political boundaries of Gary, Yes... is it part of Gary? No

" I wonder why you say ""in good faith"", are you implying that I'm not acting in good faith? The ""simplified one"" is ridiculous. According to the ""simplified"" one Spanish is only spoken near Madrid and in Andalusia, when actually it's by far the most common language throughout Spain. Obviously, regional languages exist there too, but they exist in Italy, Germany and France (actually Spain is far more homogeneous than those countries, linguistically speaking) as well, and that map simply misleads the reader. It makes you think that Spain has four equally spoken languages, whereas France, for example, only has one. That's not the case, both countries have their national language (Spanish and French, respectively) and their regional languages (Catalan, Occitan, Breton, Basque, etc.). I hope you understand my point. "

Except that it is impossible to get Sea Scout dress whites or blues from the Navy since 9/11.

Notability of DJ Eff A tag has been placed on DJ Eff, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in Wikipedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert notability may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and if you can indicate why the subject of this article is notable, you may contest the tagging. To do this, add on the top of the page (below the existing db tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm its subject's notability under the guidelines.

Kokiri (who is pro East Sea by the way) did a wonderful job at making this article NPOV. Let's keep it that way and keep only one map and keep this article clean and tidy.

The article doesn't make clear how widely this program is used; indeed, the article mentions a number of the program's shortcomings, which must limit its value.

It is a travesty to make it appear as though Mark Kirk opposes the war in Iraq despite the fact that he helped write and co-sponsored the House Resolution to invade Iraq in 2003. It is also absolutely ridiculous to boast that he received an award from the League of Conservation Voters, and yet fail to mention that the very same group gave him an ""F"" rating last Congressional session"

" You can do a ""See also"" within a footnote to accommodate a note in a note. And you certainly can have expository footnotes that explain the text more. I just read through the article again, and I think it may have gone too far in the whitewash direction: for example, it's ok to say that she clarified her educational background and have a footnote, but the footnote ought to say what was being clarified - this way is too vague and not at all clear that there was some obfuscating going on. Similarly, saying her ""role in a potential Giuliani administration"" and not saying (even in footnote) what was controversial, I think is misleading. There may be a few other places too. I'm all for NPOV and not suggesting that this be an attack article, but I think, as I said, it's gone too far over toward a whitewash. |talk "
Nearly every sentence in this submission is factually incorrect, from my birthplace (I was actually born in the Bronx, N.Y. on May 25, 1943), to the ludicrous accusations about purging gays and lesbians from SDS, to the laughable descriptions of my political history and development. Whoever wrote this obviously has their own political motives or has been fed information by Operation COINTELPRO. ( )

Hi Paul. If you look at this page's history you'll see a guy called Blofeld recently made a couple of very bizarre edits. The guy then decided he was an expert on what is probably the most obscure sultanate ever to have existed. This is obviously puzzling since the sultanate is in fact the area around my girlfriend's back garden. But this is silly. You should know already that there's a rather pitiful clique on this website. They prop each other up in spats on various talk pages; they support each other's articles in the FAC process (effectively devaluing the process as a result); and seem to enjoy stalking and baiting other users. To be frank, I think it's best to treat these little boys with the contempt they deserve. Eventually they'll get bored and start creeping round someone else. Ever heard of the forest Ton Sak Yai in Uttaradit? A few days ago I uploaded an article about Buaco Forest in Portugal. Next I intend to write a piece about Ton Sak Yai. The forest is home to the world's largest teak tree.

" You're not trying to canvas are you? Those entries are not quite enough to convince me you are, so forget it. However, I will let you know that I put an RfCreli on the talk page to drum up interest so we might want to step away from personally notifying other editors lest it look like canvasing. No, I was not trying to canvas. As you can see from the list you made, I began with the two editors who were already involved, one of whom (as you can see on my Talk page) was until then quite hostile to me. To get more people involved, what could I do - since I did not know of the method that you have kindly used on the article's Talk page - but get some Talk links from my Talk page, starting from the bottom (the most recent)? If you look at what they wrote, you will see that not all of them have always been in agreement with me; but I thought that, in this matter, the more, the better. I felt sure that scarcely anyone would support the claim of the ""owner"" of the article to control the gateway to editing it. If one of those I contacted is the editor who has since attacked Sherurcij anonymously, I was and am quite unaware of any previous conflict between him and Sherurcij. "
" In 1930, Balbo also did not fly into St. Petersburg, Mumbai or Ho Chi Minh City, because those cities were not called that in 1930 either. If Balbo had flown in 1990, he would have flown into Derry, per your petty policy. (What sort of city needs a stupid policy like this, he asked rhetorically.) Ok? Have you got it now? But this is not 1990, it's 1930. If you don't understand the difference, why are you ""working"" on an encyclopedia? Eh? Eh? Quit wasting my time with this bullshit. Bullshit is what you are pushing.

Wankel engine Your text is sure not documented! I think you have never seen a Wankel engine from inside. In other respects would you know that common piston ring material like Goetze cast iron IKA-3 and IKA-33 is used for the apex seals. Trochoiden surface chrome, chrome molybdenum, molybdenum combined with construction steel apex seals, Nikasil etc. The side surface is reagular cast iron or over eutectic alu (KSxx etc). ;) The cooling surface is smaller as for a comparable reciprocating piston engine and then should you compare the same displacement volume! Chamber volume is two times for the displacement! A 1,3ltr Wankel has a displacment of a 2,6ltr and only a surface like a 1,3ltr 4T reciprocating piston engine! That why water cooler is smaller per kW!

You are not following the admin consensus represented at WP:AN#Ayurvedra. Although your restriction was imposed in an irregular manner, it would normally remain in effect until challenged at WP:AE. It could be challenged there, and would probably be formally overturned. I won't further edit Ayurvedra, but it seems likely that my edit will stand as a necessary requirement even under your restrictions. I apologize for not challenging the restriction earlier. It would have been overturned earlier, and we could have gotten (back, perhaps) to constructive editing, which is now still virtually impossible. (talk)

I don't know. Anyone can upload those imagesit's not the uploading, it's the usage. I know the basics: covers are really only to be used in articles on the thing that the cover was the cover of. Also, a cover in an infobox on a show is ugly. Hey, I saw that thread on ANI. It's a mess and I didn't want to have to read a dozen discussions all over the place. I think one issue at the time is enough: the article and that mediation thing, that's two.

Our medical articles are always going to be somewhat difficult for readers to understand, since medical topics are usually outside of the understanding of the general public (though the general public might be familiar with some aspects). The same goes for a lot of Wikipedia science and math articles. Is there any Wikipedia medical article that is completely understandable to our non-medical readers...other than some of our WP:Stub or sort of WP:Stub articles? That stated, I do think you did okay with the lead of the Vagina article. Some of that content, as I mentioned above, was indeed unnecessarily wordy.
This article obviously needs work but this is better than nothing for the time being. I don't know why the page was deleted earlier. Consider this bit a weak stub and improve upon it if you'd like.

So 80`s were albums and 90`s were singles ok ill take your word for it. That is the exact same trend Jacksons sales took. His album sales slipt and his singles sales became increasingly significant. It wasn`t Jacksons fault albums went down it was the Market. That is what your saying. His sales with albums and singles followed the trends exactly for the 80`s and 90`s. Infact he was at the hight of these trends with HIstory. He stuck at the top of the market until 1997.

" Argument Without End citations are historical transposition? There's something in the ""Diem Era"" section stating that McNamara wrote X about motivations in Argument Without End. I would be leery of ascribing this as a contemporary statement in the 1950s (which is what the phrase indicates), because McNamara wrote the book in 1999, one of several he wrote on Vietnam long after the fact. It's obviously important (as is the other work), but I think it benefits from hindsight more than being reliable to the times, and I would rather see it placed in its own ""Legacy/Criticism/whatever"" section than being used as a reliable historical source for this article.

" Unreliable sources misquotes source Your source for the extirpation by whalers of the Atlantic gray whales is suspect. Among the two sources it cites is Bryant's 1995 paper on Atlantic gray whale specimens. Bryant (p. 860, right column) merely speculates that whaling may have been the cause of its disappearance, stating that ""This population of gray whales apparently disappeared during periods of active coastal whaling on both sides of the North Atlantic, supporting the possibility [my italics] that whaling activities were responsible for, or at least contributed to, its extinction"". However, these whaling activities (as far as we know) primarily targeted right whales, as I stated above. Earlier (p. 860, left column) he asks ""Could the eastern North Atlantic gray whale have been extirpated by whaling activities? Unfortunately, early whaling activities off the coast of Europe are poorly documented."" This alone is enough to remove your inaccurate assumption, but I'll watch as you scramble for countless secondary sources blindly repeating the same thing again and again. Have fun with that. "

"::::::Actually, he didn't say it ""should be entirely removed as an improvement to the article"". He said, ""here is my original edit, which removed material that failed WP:PEACOCK. User:Wildhartlivie restored the offending material ... Another user then re-removed the peacock terms, so, as I say, the matter is now resolved."" This did indeed resolve the issue of PEACOCK, but was not a bar to reintroducing suitable content in, as you put it, ""some modified form"" (which conformed to guidelines) to make the appropriate points in the article.

Again reinstated sentence about 7 Nobels in the first paragraph, for the reason stated above. If others disagree that this is a defining characteristic of Bx Science that should be indicated right up front in the summary paragraphs, then can we discuss it here rather than playing edit games by removing text without either edit summaries or discussion on the talk page?
You Are Useless on Wikipedia
" Removal of section However a removal of content is considered, a large chronology spanning a great length is poor way to put together an article. Please don't be an arsehole when writing your edit summaries. A stock {{test}} message in response to a good-faith edit is also rather obnoxious. I found one typo in the revision, which hardly warrants the summary ""badly spelled"". I was trying to be productive during my insomnia. Fuck you and go to hell."
KO It might also be a good idea not to taunt and brag about editors who you get banned for disagreeing with you since it makes you look immature and drunk with power. Hope this helps.
Metal Page Reverts Hey. Just a quick note to say: In a sentence, names of metal genres are done in lower case, not capital case. For instance, i suggest checking the gothic metal and symphonic metal articles. Dont worry, i got blammed for it before. Just thought id give you a nice little tip, rather then let someone else bite your head off.

And the sorry thing is someone is being the accomplice to wallow in the mire with the criminal.

The demand for sourcing is a bit unrealistic when you can just go to Den'enchfu and see for yourself. Well, chances are that you can't but as it happens I can (which means nothing) and thousands of others can too (which does mean something). I do have serious reservations about this article as it was before the latest addition/deletion/reinsertion: it seems to me to recycle stereotypes about Den'enchfu that are only partly true. (Also, I'm pretty sure that at least one of the photos isn't of Den'enchfu, and the others are uninformative.)

Gorbachov went to the West with a begging bowl and cap in hand, and was told to go home. The USSR then broke up in what Putin called the biggest geo-political mistake ever. People (in the West) here can make as much fun out of the China and the Chinese as they like, but it is the Russians they have to watch because Russia will soon want its empire back. The all conquering Russians are now even claiming the North Pole as part of their territory. Would you not want the Chinese on your side when this happens?

But then rest assured, your Kannad author Mr.Kamat's references from all the articles that Kannambadi has kannadized will also be removed. So, please cool down your rhetorics as they ain't gonna scare Mahawiki or me. By the way, Sarvagnya, I must point out that what you're doing is Wikistalking ! Isn't it ?

Choose your Loyalties Sir, It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi. My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.) Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it. But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape. Sincerely yours, A proud AMERICAN

This conforms to both general Wikipedia guidelines and those of the Wp Star Trek wikiproject. This reference is no less germane than (in the same section) individuals who have been reared in the language and the flotsam of other refs throughout the article.

And even the Wife of Socrates, legend tells us, complaint about those activities - did he LOVE philosophy more than her? Anyway, this STRUGGLE is between TWO and TW0.

" US emissions description is totally contentless now. The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US ""partial zero emissions vehicle"" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case. Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information. Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia. It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad ""20mpg"" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now. Regards: Tamas Feher from Hungary ""etomcat@freemail.hu"""

" By the way, Montanabw, you are effectively retarded. I can source everything I'm saying. Look for the book: ""Pleistocene Mammals of North America"" By Bjrn Kurtn and Elaine Anderson, just for starters. Now that will require that you read something other than a webpage (actually, you can read part of it online even). There are many sources on Equine evolution and taxonomy. I'm not, however, going to hand them over to you on a silver platter while you feel unristricted in espousing your own ENTIRELY unverifiable claims. Here's a suggestion: read something that isn't written by people lobbying for feral horse protection. You'll get a lot more truthful information out of it. I also don't think it was you that reverted my edit of the Mustang article (not that it needed to be, there are millions of you thoroughly ignorant goons), I was actually looking up sources when I came back and saw it had already been changed and thought; ""Jesus, what's the point?""

I've been asked to give my thoughts on this matter, and I do feel that a line must be drawn and that this team is certainly not notable for WP. If you think hard enough, every minor or children's league is notable to someone. Notable items here need to be notable to a wide region, state, country, not just a city. I think keeping info about the leagues is fine, I have no problem with that at this point. The junior team articles I have seen so far just say the team name and the city, even though it is already stated in the league article. And they will not get any bigger or better unless a lot of unnotable cruft is placed in, which is the last thing that WP needs. And as for the wikiproject, you don't have to obey to the original standards. A wikiproject is designed to give a community for editors to collaborate on a subject, it's not meant to be official policy. I am stunned that an article like this is kept, it is not even close to being notable outside the area of the team, and should be removed, no doubt about it.

Gurkhas and French Foreign Legionnaires are not mercenaries Hi Philip. I see you reverted my change, without responding to the reason I gave. Basically my thinking is, there is no single definition of what a mercenary is, so the section on Gurkha and FFL needs to say according to which definition/s they aren't considered mercenaries. If their is some fundamental law of nature saying they aren't mercs, then why include them in the article on mercenaries at all? (Anymore than a section in the Birds article called Dogs are not birds). Presumably it is included because there is some sort of controversy, and as written it seems very POV. (For the record, I don't think they are mercs, but the section needs to be brought up to wikipedia standard). Regards,

Legal Aspects New Source Turns out that Israel has issued a legal brief defending its conduct in regards to the blockade and raid. I am not, at this time, interested in getting involved in editing the legal aspects section, but thought this would be a great source for those who were.
" ""Impact on popular culture"" not ""important"" ""The film has had an important, albeit small impact on popular culture."" ""Important impact on popular culture"" is almost an oxymoron to begin with, but beyond that, the cultural references listed fail to establish the ""importance"" of this impact. 201.53.7.16 "

"::::::So you're arguing that an organization can be gay one minute and not gay the next, depending on its popularity and which way the prevailing political winds are blowing, and that encyclopedia content should be constantly varying, according to the instantaneous reading of some sort of gay-o-meter? For the purposes of documenting history, this is probably not the right definition of ""gay"" to employ. At a rally trying to make a persuasive argument for gay rights, it probably is. Since Wikipedia is factual knowlege, and not a rally, the gay community doesn't get to vote on the daily gayness of gay things, and that includes NAMBLA, which is a gay organization. "

" Am I the only one who isn't getting any text in that article (except the first line)?? Firefly322, if you want to write an article but only have headings right now, you should seriously consider using your userspace to develop it at least to have some content. However, there are concerns about duplicating/forking content, so maybe you should be sure it's going to be a productive/worthwhile use of your time. I would also point out that it is not our job to teach first-year physics with calculus, nor are we here to write articles ""For Physicists and Engineers."" "

" I have absolutely no connection to this subject, and am indeed preparing to write stories about other crooners as well.

Pardon me if I'm good at doing my homework. I am more than happy to scan and email my ID, or sign a notarized statement with proof of my identity (or even Skype) should anyone feel the need for such confirmation. My screen name was ""Croonerman"" long before I'd ever heard of this singer, and the only reason I did was because I searched my long held screenname of ""croonerman"" on Google. I use that name as I am a fan of crooners in general, including Frank Sinatra. "

Compromise for introduction I propose to add the following as introduction. The Safavids (1501-1722) were a Turkic-speaking Shiite dynasty which ruled Iran from 1502 till 1722 (though several Safavid rulers were nominally reigning until 1736)[3]. The Safavid empire originated in the city of Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and had its origins in the Shiite Safaviyyeh Order. Safavids combined the elements of Turkic tribal militancy with Persian cultural identity and the Shiite teachings of Islam to assert the contemporary Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiite identity. During their reign, Safavids established a vast Iranian empire including the whole of modern Iran and the parts of modern Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, South Caucasus and Turkey. After we finally agree on the introduction, let's discuss next the origins part. Thanks.

It's interesting that this IP feels they know me so well, when I have had limited interaction with you. We have never actively engaged each other on talk pages. It's amazing you somehow have been able to edit every page I edit; every photograph you crop is mine. Have you wondered where this ire against me and my work has come from? You continually put a photo of a man in a wig (a photoshopped wig, at that) on the Afro page, and four different editors have removed it, five if you include me. This is what you consider ownership and edit warring? Then you have taken my photographs and decided to rename them simply to remove David Shankbone out of the file name. Your intentions are no pure. You are gaming the policies and guidelines to Wikistalk me. You say not to bite the newcomers, but I haven't actively engaged you. If you are a newcomer, how come you have such a handy knowledge of Wiki policies and guidelines? Why is every page in your history one I have contributed to? What is your issue with me, in particular? You have also done all of this under another IP,

" Yes, the graph is misleading, but many textbooks and research papers have similar Arrhenius plots which do not show the true y-axis. The reason is that k varies very rapidly with T so that it is usually only convenient to study a small range of T, here 590-660 K. The true y-axis at x = 1/T = 0 corresponds to infinite T and is very far from the experimental range, or ""way off the graph"". If we insist on a graph which goes to x = 0, the measured points will cover only a small part of the graph which would make it hard to understand. (It would also have led to inaccurate determination of Ea in the days when slopes were determined manually with graph paper, although this is no longer true since slopes are now determined by linear regression with a spreadsheet such as Excel.) So instead of replacing the graph, I will explain in the article that the left side of the graph is not in fact the y-intercept, and that ln A corresponds to the true y-intercept which must be calculated. Putting a // on the x-axis is also a good idea which I have seen in some textbooks, if someone has the software to re-draw the graph that way. "

Question relating to the deletion of article [[Jamie Darlington]. Is it because the article was created by myself? I have just read the guidelines on that, however it was not written by myself.

I have had a go at re-writing this article to avoid paraphrasing but without much success. I just seem to end up with a biographical article about Elizabeth Woodville, which Wikipedia already has. Given the fact that the notability of the article has been questioned, can I suggest that it is marked for deletion, and that I could add a brief note to the article on Philippa Gregory indicating that the White Queen is a novel about the life of Elizabeth Woodville, queen consort of Edward IV and mother of the princes in the tower. Anyone interested in the plot could follow a link to the Elizabeth Woodville article.

It's become an informal consensus among WP:BASEBALL editors (though it's not yet written into WP:NSPORTS, I'll propose it) that we should consider college baseball First Team All-Americans to be notable. In the three cases I'm working on today (Martin, Michael Roth (baseball) and Jason Krizan), they seem to meet GNG. The individuals on those minor league prospect pages generally don't have the same level of notability, though I'm sure some of them do deserve their own pages already.

You are right, that today Bollywood is refered only to Hindi film industry today. But unfortunately some Westerners still use Bollywood as whole Indian film industry. The businessweek article author is one of them, although he used an asterisk to clear, that he means the whole Indian industry. Shshshshsh uses the dumbness of the businessweek author to implicate, that Bollywood (the hindi industry only!!) is the largest in the world. This is vandalism.

Bongwarrior's mother loves to have sex with African Americans because she is a dirty whore who is addicted to crack. Shoe began whoring herself out to gangs of African Americans when she was 16 to support her habit. One night, she conceived Bongwarrior with one of her black pimps when she was 15. After Bongwarrior was born, she gave him to her pimps, who pimped him out too. As a result, Bongwarrior's anus suffered extensive damage. He cannot control his defectaroy patterns, as a result of which he has to wear diapers. Bongwarrior hates it when IP-hopping vandals inform the world of the truth about his mother. He also doesn't realize that if he blocks an IP address, all the IP-hopping vandal has to do is weight for 10 minutes and then get a new IP address. He is so retarted. Or maybe he can't think because he is currently getting fucked in the ass by his mother's black pimp right now.

J'accuse Specifically, I accuse Angus McGeddon of infidelity to a heinous degree. First, he outcasted his wife Karis for failing to have children. Then he proceeded to engage in a Tryst with Sylvia Simon-Simon, who died bearing his love-child - the same child who is even now being raised by the McGeddon family, due to our patriarchal society's rules. Sylvia passed on before she was willing to speak about the nature of her contact with Mr. McGeddon, but she was a lady of the faith and I suspect her of no wrongdoing.

"::::::I'm not sure if ""See also"" sections are supposed to have descriptions for the links they provide, but in this case I think little descriptions won't hurt. I.e. non-believers, for one, will find a link to Luther's Small Catechism odd, especially since that article doesn't mention Bach. Would you be so kind to add a few small clarifications? I.e. something like ""Luther's Small Catechism, the Catechism Bach taught to students at the Thomasschule"" (assuming it was Thomasschule, as I have no idea) instead of a simple link. Also, Christian symbolism in Bach's works is certainly an interesting topic, and it is already mentioned in the ""Style"" section. Perhaps one day someone will feel bold enough to create something like Musical style of Johann Sebastian Bach, and then we'd have enough space to elaborate on this aspect of Bach's work. For now, though, the article is already way too large (and has to grow larger, as there are few inline citations, the References section is underdeveloped, etc.). "

Comment on Implementations There is 3rd common way of implementing deques and that is as an array of pointers to fixed sized pages of the elements (usually a power of 2, even 1 element) The advantage of this scheme is that if new elements are inserted at the front or end of the deque, pages containing elements in the middle of the deque need not be disturbed. Nearly all the C++ vendor implement in this fashion. Note also: The C++ deque cannot be implemented using an array. There is a requirement that references to elements in the middle of a deque remain valid if only the only thing done to the deque is add new elements at either end. An array implementation would fail when the array needs to be reallocated.

Hi Cmelbye - I'm still in the process of getting the basics in place, thanks for asking. I'm looking forward to actually working on some new chains... In response to your suggestion, I found a page-creation extension that automatically inserts the contents of another page into the new page: http://www.chainsofreason.org/wiki/Chains_of_Reason:Create_a_new_chain I think this is a great improvement, so thanks for the suggestion. However, as you will see on the above page, users still have to work-out for themselves what number they should give a new chain. And if it is not a recycled number, then they have to first add the new chain title to the top of the list at the bottom of the page, so it would be good to be able to also automate this process of determining what number to give a new chain, taking into account the need to recycle the titles of any deleted chains. Any ideas?!

. This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt

Why did you erase ABA can cure autism. I added a ref tag that leaded to the website saying that, the first person who invented Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), cured dozens of kids and was very successful. My son had autism until he was 5, he had no language, had motor skills, constant tantrums/meltdowns, avoided eye contact, he would cry when the motor in the back of the car would star it would hurt his ears Sensory Issues, he had trauma, sleeping problems etc. He had an ABA Home-Instructed Program, it turned out very succesful, he gained his language, and no longer had autism, he is a pre-teen now and goes to a special-ed school for the IQ of average or above, he is functioning now. So I know this for a fact. It even said it on the article, but doesn't mean every person with autism could get better from it through early intervention, not with severe autism. So could you please revert my edit. Thanx!

Of course it was inappropriate language - and I am bound to apologise. Edit summaries are trickier places for this sort of thing as they are added in the spur of the moment and there is no taking them back once they're made. On the other hand some of your own remarks (not to me, but to other editors) on the open talk page, have also not been very conducive to the assumption of good faith. Pots calling kettles black and all that. Not that I mean that as any excuse, 'cause it's not, but ... I haven't looked yet, but I do hope any response to my remarks there was taken in the kindly spirit in which they were meant.

Yes, it is a transliteration, and it looks Cantonese to me. I found websites giving it as the Chinese name for it. Even though I wasn't able to identify the exact dialect or transcription system, I thought this name might be useful. The numerals indicate the tone with which the syllable is pronounced.

In September I [notified DavidRubin about Guido's behaviour http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Davidruben#Guido_-_up_to_his_old_tricks_again.3F] but he chose not to do anything, so it certainly isn't as if DavidRuben is just waiting for an excuse to ban Guido.

reply I think the one that has gone far is the IP annonymous user. He reverts every edit users make in the Dominica Republic without caring about what other user believe. I been in wikipedia for past half a year and have made numerous articles and he is the first person that gotten me angry. Wikipedia is suppose to be a place for concensus not self edits like the annonymous sure did...Right now they are 4 people(counting me) that go against his policies and then he warns us of vandalizing the Article. WE are dominican and we knoe the history of our country while he blames us that we are only racist and go against African Blood..I think you should warn him too the same way you did to me because the only one responsible of my acts is him. You could ask users like User:Dominican,User:VirtualDelight and others that know the truth and that they always back my points while IP User:64.131.205.111. I never have come here to disturb and always got along with other wikipedians like User:Moebiusuibeom-en. He Accussed more than twice about vandalism and i think that if you neutral enough you should warn his of being blocked too...He comes up here and make himself seem as an innocent editor while he is truly not. Thats all i have to say and i'll say one thing more..If he continues acussing me i will continue offending him the same way i've done it before(because he is not the only one here with priviledges).
aha, the Bengal famine of 1943 article seems rather balanced on this. It appears the British did f*ck up logistically, while holding on with their fingernails to the war effort, but no evil negligence is implied. ()

You're right. I don't like how Wikipedia works, I don't like any of the experienced editors. I shouldn't be here. I did not insult anyone because I think I'm better. I do not want a Wikipedia page for your previously stated reasons. I use Wikipedia and consider it credible.nif anyone can tell you how big my dick is, it's me. Neither you nor your website give me any clout. I wasn't promoting. What am I going to say, hey go check out my Wikipedia. Fuck you, your editor friends and Wikipedia. And fuck my Wikipedia page I dont want one add that to my wiki I hope they ban me and delete my account so I don't have to do it
Actually, I think it's okay to list there even if it's not an actual dispute, unlike most RfC listings. However, I've reduced it to a brief description of what you're doing, in keeping with the format of the page, otherwise it would get overwhelmed with chatter. But if you're trying to publicize this as a new project, I would recommend focusing on the village pump (looks like you've already been there) and Wikipedia:Goings-on. 18:02, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Do remember that the martyrdoms which have the most lasting influence on Christian art, from St. Lawrence to St. Catherine [of Alexandria], rank from dubious to evidence-free; are there artistic traditions even of spurious martyrdoms of real people, like Clement and his anchor? (To avoid the obvious, I'm not discussing the Crucifixion; putting it under the head of persecutions of Christianity would be an original - although not unreasonable - synthesis.) This may belong in a section or subarticle on Roman Catholic culture, but not history; and I agree sourcing will be a bear. PMAnderson

response to JamesBWatson Thank you for your reply. Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not.

" Jayjg this is nonsense. You are misquoting the subject. Milliband didn't simply say ""I'm Jewish"", he said ""Obviously I'm Jewish, it is part of my identity, but not in a religious sense."" Milliband recognised that simply saying ""I'm Jewish"" would lead many hearers to make a religious assumption, so he qualified it. You say ""but saying you are Jewish doesn't imply religiousness"" and I immediately accusing you of doing exactly what you accuse others of doing - imposing your meaning of what ""Jewish"" means. That's what you said was original research, isn't it? Milliband obviously recognised that simply saying ""I'm Jewish"" would mislead at least some hearers into making a religious assumption - which is why qualified his self-identity. Now if you label him as ""Jewish"" - and stick him in an unqualified Jewish box, you leave open the very misinterpretation that he was at pains to exclude. And you do it by saying ""here is how I define Judish identity"" and worse by ignoring the fact that some/many people hearing ""Jewish"" don't share your preconception. The subject has said what the subject has said. We should record it. We should not qualify it, truncate it, ignore it - or say ""your fears of misinterpretation are ill-founded, and thus your qualification unnecessary"".Scott Mac "

, 9 January 2013 (UTC) Thanks, I found it at Amazon yesterday so thought I'd have a go at uploading it. I like what you've done with the quote. I think the background is the appropriate place to discuss the response to what Hedren claims. I'm not sure whether we need to include the Telegraph article in the criticism section now as it's mentioned earlier, so I'll take that bit out. You can always restore it if you don't agree though. Another thing we may need to add is some viewing figures for the film's US and UK television debuts. Finding them for the UK seems quite straightforward, but I can't seem to track them down for the US. If you can help with that it would be much appreciated. Cheers 13:26

"*he didnt say just ""genetics"", he said DESCENT (can you read ?). Where do you think you come from, a fuckin test tube ? Ask anybody, alot of your ethnic or cultural identity is inherited or passed down from you ancestors/family. Actually read what hes saying you dumbass, your personality/behaviour, your genes, you physical appearance and for many people alot of other cultural customs like language you get from your family since they raise you. The common descent of a group of people is where alot of this comes from. Obviously when you live in a a community with others of this heritage, that identity lasts longer. Thats why on average Irish (not Scots-Irish), Italians, Germans, Blacks/Africans, Asian, Native Indians, Spanish/Hispanics keep more of their identity longer here in the USA then other peeps like English and Scottish. You walk in my neighbourhood and say im only an ""ethnic American"" or somethin stupid like that, you get knocked the fuck out. You people need to wake the fuck up. "

You idiot, ever since I first heard of Santa when I was 4 years old I NEVER believed he was real. Any kid who is SMART AND LOGICAL would never believe it either. My parents never gave me stupid delusions of it either. I used to go around my 2nd-grade class and say Santa wasn't real and the teacher told me to stop but I didn't. You are preventing children from developing their logical thinking skills if you tell them it's possible to travel to every household in Christendom in a single night. Considering in TV and movies Santa spends at least a few minutes inside a house delivering presents and eating cookies. The time doesn't add up. Those were my exact thoughts at 4 years old and that's how I deduced he couldn't be real. If your kid doesn't think like that he's retarded and you're not helping him by saying that's possible.

" Suggest renaming This article is (as currently written) really about the prospective effects of global warming on humans, not the general effects of climate change. An article as broadly titled as this on the ""effects of climate change"" would have to speak about climate changes generally. These would perforce include historic ""effects of climate change"" such as the Little Ice Age, the Roman Warming Period, Ice Ages, etc. We could include such historic climate effects here, but given the thrust of the article it would probably be best just to do a renaming.

" Another thought - is describing the word as a ""neologism"" superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. ""Neologism"" is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism. I think it's probably sufficient simply to say when and by whom the term was coined. Comments? AW"

" EditFilter Idea I originally posted this to Triplestop, but he suggested I ask you. I've been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates, a fairly common and sneaky problem. I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else. I am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now: (user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike ""dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\(born |\(b\. "") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike """") Where I have is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010). Here's the regex (date of birth *=+|b\.[^&-]+(&.dash;|-+)|\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\.?[^0-9\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\{\{birth[^\}]+\}\}).*$ I don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along. "

was too strong an action in this case especially given that user Trampikey seems to have a record for making arbitrary decisions that he is correct and everyone else is wrong. The most that was required was someone to contact me pointing me in the right direction to take this up or, at most, a time limited ban. To make things worse I have now twice emailed NLU who hasn't even had the courtesy to reply. Please consider reverting this ban. Regards Gudyrinit (Bill)

I do think of you as a twerp, calling me that hurts, honestly. "
I am in complete agreement with Kelisi on this one. One of the disturbing trends that I have witnessed on Wikipedia has been the propensity of users to actually REDUCE article sizes and chop out pertinent information. This is supposed to be a comprehensive encyclopedia and information database. By reducing article sizes and taking out relevant information about the topic itself, you are no longer facilitating the spread of knowledge or shared interests and it goes against the very principles of Wikipedia itself. Why would someone take out pictureso of the school or the staff and administration? That just seems inane to me.

" Understanding ""Wikified"" language Hi, and thanks for taking the time to ""Wikify"" the language I added to ""Ballast Point"". If you don't mind, I would like to ask a question so I can better understand this; I am new to this, still learning. The background is that in the 1800s, the European settlement of the Sydney area was in its early days. Place names were informal, and often duplicated. There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as ""Ballast Point"" then. This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name. The revised wording gives me the impression that there was only one place of that name in the 1800s, and it changed. So can you please indicate why the new wording is preferred, so I can adopt the best approach in future? "
Mind your own business, you troll.
There is no explaining things civally to idiots who don't grasp facts. It would appear that insults are the only things people understand on this website. You have no idea how many times I have tried to explain facts to idiots cival. They just don't grasp. And it makes me sick that the people with power on this site revert FACTS to false information and block those who try to make this place a better source.

":::Furthermore, although I am a political opponent of James on many levels, it is not I who believes that calling him a ""faggot"" will hurt his cause on a political level. You just refuse to acknowledge that he was called this during the reign of his son, to (according to the accepted standards of the time period), thought it would be scandalous and outright damaging to his rule. Because of their convention, the slurs did help portray his rule as the beginning of the end for those who were out to get him. Now, you repeat homophobic insults and intertwine your own homosexuality with his identity, although he was a straight man stuck in a quicksand of backbiting, that included homophobic language. Why perpetuate falsehoods, other than to make yourself feel better that somebody famous is alleged to be gay like you, especially if you like to smear him as a hypocrite, for all the abuse you suffered by fundie Bible thumpers?

Hi, welcome to Wiki. Your recent series of edits have been reverted by multiple editors, primarily because Wiki receives many vandal attacks which 'just add 1cm' etc and do not contain any explanation or reference. I believe that your edits were made in good faith, but they should each contain a reference from a reliable source and an explanation in the editorial comments. Regards.
I will not contact anyone. If the article was deleted, it sort of follows that it's content did not belong on Wikipedia. Additionally, if you are looking to inform your future students, you have better ways of doing so. (E.g. Your own website.) Do read WP:NOT.

" Notability of Chelsea Heinze A tag has been placed on Chelsea Heinze, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ""db"" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this. "

" I told you in my first response that the problem is the attitude of the other user. We are past the curling box issue. The issue is the other user acting as if they are the supreme lord of wikicurling, creating rules and guidelines that have not been discussed with other group members and then enforcing them upon everyone else. You just said what I've been trying to get across this whole time ""We are all volunteers here, so nobody can be compelled to do anything they don't want to do."" If the other user would change their attitude there wouldn't be an issue. There was never a problem with things until this last year when the user created ""guidelines"" and then started enforcing them. I've been a member of the group for a few years, and not once was I ever messaged to review these guidelines or participate in creating and developing them. The other user solely created them and started enforcing them. It's not fair that I am at risk of being sanctioned because the other user thinks they are in charge and can do whatever they want. I have never had problems with any other user on this website, and now it seems like I'm being targeted because the other user wants to get their own way. "

" ""A considerable number of Israeli citizens who were born in the former SU are ethnic Russians"" - i doubt it considerably. i think that out of the 100K russian citizens in israel (those are the people who immigrated after 1997) there are about 50% NON-jews as the israel statistics show. and so the number 50K might be very accurate. others out of the 300K non jews in israel mostly are ukrainians. oohh... really who gives a damn?"
User Nikkul changed the lead sentence and he is keen to use terms like financial/entertainment capital of india, most populous city of india etc. I think, and just like Calcutta and Bangalore which are FA as well, mentioning Mumbai is the capital of Indian state of Maharashtra is important followed by 'biggest' financial capital kind of abjectives.

In response to request above: I have never used a sock account and do not support the use of socks for myself. The administrator who originally placed the block on my account asserted that I was a sock of when he started this ANI post (I was completely blocked during this time and could not respond). WP:DUCK was citied as the reason; a previous investigation confirmed that Biasprotector, Ricky28618 and Rickywatcher were sockpuppets of Biaswarrior. However, if one reviews the contributions and editing patterns of Biaswarrior, Biasprotector, Ricky28618 and Rickywatcher, they all exhibit a pattern of many 'Wiki admin' posts over a very brief span of time (hours or a few days) before burning out. My contributions have been done over a 3-year period and tend to focus on page maintenance of subjects I have knowledge of, like Monterey County, other Northern California locations, western Iraq towns, military & Navy subjects, and railroading. I did nominate 21 stub pages for speedy deletion in rapid succession, but did so with the hope that an administrator would rule on my suggestions, which they did (denying rapid deletion) and I accept it. It was done in good faith and I have apologized several times for the scramble-edit, explained in the initial unblock request above. On a subsequent ANI thread, an administrator commented at the end of the post added here that a positive step would be for me to apologize. I have done so in a genuine manner here, here and here. Please advise if you like me to address any additional concerns. Thanks for considering my request.

Religious grounds Surely under canon law, a civil marriage is not valid anyway. So regardless of whether Mrs Simpson had been married before and regardless of whether Mrs Simpson had not annuled her marriages but divorced, then surely Mrs. Simpson was not validly married under canon law. Therefore, any religious marriage she would later partake in would be a valid marriage under canon law and would make her eligable to become Queen. The political implications (given that civil law is a legal marriage within the state) is a different matter but as she was divorced under civil law there surely was no hindrance to any subsequent remarriage.

Yes, had the West shown active involvement in the crisis in 1992, there would be no problem with the Mujahideen. But we didn't, and we tolerated their presence in Bosnia instead of lifting the arms embargo ourselves. Not until after Sept. 11th did the US become concerned about their presence there. This point is important and well-documented.

Replacing deleted material Ari, you have never seen an attack from me. Let me give you a demonstration of an attack so that in the future you will not play at accusing me of attacking you when I am clearly not. - - You are an abomination, a travesty of a human being and an embarrassment as a Christian. You are your mother's sorrow and your father's chagrin. You are a wolf, a fraud, and thief, a liar, a plagiarist, a punk, and creep, a low-life nobody. Just the thought of you makes my skin crawl. I picture you as a fat, ugly, stinky piece of garbage with bad teeth. You demonstrate all that is wrong with the world today. Your behavior makes honest people loose heart. You are the sign that we are all doomed. You are the culmination of thousands of years of bad decisions by self-serving leaders, poor education, and bad breeding. You are refuse with a computer. Who do you think you are writing about important topics? Who told you anyone cares what you have to say? Oh, was it your fellows who help you beat people down and ply your filthy trade here on Wikipedia? You stupid puke. - - Now in the future I hope you will know when you are being attacked and stop your silly playing for the benefit of the administrators. Poor fool. I've been saying for some time now that I hate it here. Did you think you could keep up your nasty stuff and get politeness in return?

" Hi. The ""six-month"" expiration was created for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012 page. It's not that sources ""expire"" as you said, but on that primary page, candidates were was broken down into four categories - declared candidates, currently speculated candidates, formerly speculated candidates and declined. So, once a speculated candidate was no longer being speculated about, he or she wasn't deleted, they were simply moved to the ""formerly speculated"" section. Because Senate, Congressional and Gubernatorial elections pages make no distinction between ""currently"" and ""formerly"" speculated candidates, it doesn't apply. Not in this cycle, in the 2014 cycle, in the 2012 cycle or 2010 and so on. Thanks, "

On the scales that youre talking about fewer than a hundred unique sites put together (15 vs. 69 a ratio of 1:4, not 1:6), both forms are so rare as to make such comparisons almost irrelevant. For this hypothetical reader who wouldnt be able to figure out what ecumenopoleis means from the context, it is given as a plural form at the beginning of the article. It is patronising in the extreme to assume that using the etymologically correct plural will cause such difficulties particularly as all readers need do if they are confused is open the ecumenopoleis article in a new tab / window to be told what it means in the first sentence. The last remaining argument is sthetic it is undeniable that a ending sounds a lot better, and is far easier to say, than a ending.

" speedy deletion of The Present (2009 film) I don't understand why my article on The Present (2009 film) has been deleted. The A7 criteria specifically excludes products of people (such as books, albums, etc) are excluded and I would assume the etc. would include films. Anyways, the article should be considered notable because the lead actor has worked with famous musicians such as Britney Spears and Mariah Carey and one of the co-stars, George Nozuka is a current R&B; singer in Canada with #1 singles to his credit. I would like to have my article reposted or at least an explanation of why it was ""speedily deleted"". Thank you. "

Yes, unfortunately, what happened was what is called a WP:Close paraphrase, something that was present in some of the other rewrites I have reviewed those past days, but here to an extent where it was not directly fixable by myself. I chose to remove the entire career section but still restore the rest because the lead + discography were building a viable stub, which BTW contains every single reference present at the time of the review. I'll be looking in the full copyvio version to see if there is anything else and port it back into the article when I have a moment. As I expect will confirm, close paraphrasing is where copyright laws become really tough to comply with, and I sympathize with the difficulty this presents. Nonetheless, I cannot, for obvious reasons, restore the text of the career section, as any modification of that would constitute an unauthorized derivative. And of course, I appreciate that the fact that only admins can verify my statement makes it doubly difficult. That being said, I'd welcome a second look from Frank or MRG if this is desirable.

Poland's population I found something a bit strange in Poland's population figures. If I go to the Demographics of Poland, I see that Poland's population is doubtfully increasing, and when I take a look to country's profile, I see a low decrease from 38 230 000 to 38 123 000. Can someone give me an answer is Poland's population is really increasing?. Thanks, Arthur 13 August 2006
Sick POV What the hell? User:Izady is a sick fuck: It should be noted that the conditions in which individuals died varies from site to site. The people that were buried in these graves are believed to have been members of the Kurdish population which was in support of Iranian occupancy of Iraq at the time of their death (circa 1980's) 'and who deserved to die in the hands of patriotic Sunni Arabs of Iraq'. The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.

" About religious zealots attempting to delete the truth Despite your delirious notions that homosexuality is a ""disease"" to be ""cured"", the fact of the matter is that it isn't and it can't be, the more scientific studies are done on the subject, the more your lies disintegrate when exposed to the daylight. Anyway, if you could please not resort to your usual behavior towards the truth, which is usually trying to delete it when it doesn't serve your purpose, I would appreciate it. Anyway, the reason I reverted CC80's edit is because this is a section devoted towards ""Behavior modification"", I really don't see how it's ""unbalanced"", it mentions the techniques that have been tried (and failed) to ""cure"" a ""disease"" that doesn't exist, and I cited it properly with respected organizations, such as the APA.

The symbolism should be analyzed, organized, compared to other instances, and linked to relevant articles, to better understand. At least make a list of symbols used. This is one of the most encyclopedia-friendly books in the Book, and could shed light on topics such as Cherub, Vision (religion), Cubit, &c.; Feel free to draw your own (accurate) version, as images can bypass the no-original-research rule. A beautiful picture could earn the article status such as ""cool"" with females or ""Royal"" with England. But it doesn't have to be National-Geographic-quality.

It should be pointed out that the decline has been reversed and the population has grown between 2000 and 2008.

We have been pasting/updating the page with EXACT quotes from Jeremy and you call it BIASED, POV and CONTROVERSIAL and then paste Jeremy's lie without clarifying that he is incorrect. Do you work for AlQaeda theJPS? What is wrong with you people. It's more of a shrine for Jeremy Clarkson than anything else with crooked people posting MISINFORMATION and then locking the page!

You people need to be stopped! Jeremy's xenophobic name calling and silly comments about certain nationalities are funny and fine, but when he lies about LAWS within a particular country you should not present in such an ambiguous fashion. This is a totally different game. The page is now full of you know what and you've locked it. Weasel! All we can do is complain about you.

Words of Encouragement in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia. User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not. He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia. How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member. So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda. Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources. I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.

"==Number of Adepts == Because Spiritist Moviment doesn't proselytizes and is not a religious denomination (as states in the article), there is no current estimation for the number of Spiritists in Brazil. The IBGE estimation came from the census on religion, but many Spiritists do not consider themselves Spiritism ""followers"", because it is not a religion. Another poll made by a established poll research institution in Brazil shows that half of Brazilian population believes in reincarnation. Once Buddhism and Hinduism are almost non-existent in Brazil, it shows the strong influence of The Spiritist Doctrine and other native believes in Brazil. Moreover, in another poll (Rede Globo Mineira, 2000) in the populous State of Minas Gerais, Chico Xavier, the most popular spiritist medium in Brazil, was elected the Mineiro (Minas's citizen) of the century, competing against other popular celebrities like the former President Juscelino Kubischeck and inventor Santos Dumont. Recently Epoca Magazine comments an statistic of 20 to 30 millions of spiritists in Brazil. For the reasons above I'm removing the badly grounded statistics about the number of spiritists in Brazil.

Mission High graduate? Hello Zedla, I am still looking for a link to the fact that I actually attended and graduated from Mission High School in San francisco in 1972, an experience I can vouch for but you seem to think you can question. I may have to go over there, ask the librarian for a copy of the 1972 yearbook and scan it, or maybe I can dig out my construction paper diploma, but I know where I went to high school and you don't, so please, give me a few weeks to seek out my proof. Besides, anyone who would try and claim to have graduated from my poorly funded, strife-ridden inner city high school would probably be a little sick in the head.
"::::::::: It is unprudent to claim that the fact who started the war,is ""irrelevent"".Any law collage student knows that from the standpoint of the international legal system,it is of crucial importance to determine who was the agressor.In our case,there is no doubt that georgian government violated the peace agreement and brutally attacked S.Ossetia in early August of 2008,hoping Russia will turn a blindeye on the assasination of its peace-keepers and its citizens as well as on the violation of the previous agreements.The sheer brutality of georgian attack accounted for much damage of civil buildings in Tskhinvali as well as for hundreds of casualties among the ossetian population. - - In this sense,we have right to blame georgian side for ANY damage and ANY casualties that have been the consequence of the georgian-started war.

Sir, not only do you constantly assume bad faith, you abuse your powers as an admin in terms of venting your privately held sexual frustrations in dealing with other peoples work. You also advertise blatantly on your userpage, an offence I brought up before but which you remarkably labeled 'vandalism'. Several of your articles do not cite sources, therefore not establishing notability in the field they claim to represent. Your response to all of this will be of course to 'remove this' as vandalism. To that I say to you, you are pathetic. You are a cretin. Only by replying to me will I stop. Sir, I am a reasonable man but your constant incivility is driving me over to the edge. Already I have made legal challanges to your position here; You may consider me to be a troll, but I am a long gone editor, wanting to drag you down like the slimeball you are. You are the kind of fucking imbecile which is dragging this place down to its knees. When will you learn that it is common fucking human decency to reply to somebody when they approach you with a genuine question. What do you say?
Page Protection Thank you for protecting the page. Would you be kind enough to put at least 5 days of protection. Due to timezone differences people will not be able to discuss anything during 48 hours, and the dispute in question has been discussed multiple times on the talkpage, but every time the protection ends an edit war erupts and the discussion comes to a halt without anything having been accomplished. So if you give us at least 5 days, we may be able to work to some consensus. Regards

hello again I am BACK WITH A VENGENCE!!!!!! alright, so will block me, thats expected, so with that note on mind, i begin my rant. My Rant FUCK is an interesting word, and can be used in many ways. such as, FUCK YOU, Go Fuck yourself (no one else will) I FUCKED your mother, also who the FUCK do you think you are? do you think you are god? is that it? were you molested by your teacher as a child? i dont understand what would cause you to think your so fucking great. i raped all of your family members, and siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles. i also raped your mother (she liked it) and so you are nothing. ABSOLUTLY nothing, and you should terminate your existance A.S.A.P. (As Soon As Possible just letting you know, because you are FUCKING RETARTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) FUCK YOU, and go die. that is all. ps you fudge packing ass-monger, i have one last thing to say to you. DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!fucker i hope you rot in hell you son of a skank.
I didn't even say or imply that I have a problem with you improving articles, if the tone of the comment suggested that I did then I apologize. I was just curious to know how you can declare an article 'yours'. Thanks for replying to my question.

" visual examples of painting media This article is very limited as to the types of paint media. There should be a full article on oil painting, etc... At the absolute least this page should present a visual example of all of the types of painting media. To have two ""fresco"" examples and nothing for pastel, watercolor, ink, gouache, enamel, spray paint, tempera, or water miscible oil paint, is very lacking. Providing 1-2 examples of each would improve this section greatly. It may be a rare prose-to-image ratio spacially (i.e. more images per area than normally used) but it would help make up for the lack of extended articles, because we all know a picture is worth 1,000 words, right?

" Requested move A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge The actual copyright of the film is this title. The opening credits of the film say ""Part 2"", and the credits on the actual film posters say ""Part 2"". Only some marketing ads don't include the ""Part"" in the title, but, as I stated above, it was originally copyrighted into the title. Here is a link to the original copyright in 1985. As far as searching goes, I don't think this will disrupt anything, but I feel that it should be the accurate title. This was discussed a year ago, but the initial request was based on an inaccurate title that had a comma and appears to confusion the real issue. I point to the copyright, the poster credit (not the poster artwork), and the actual opening title of the film as reason to include ""Part"" in the title. (Contact me) "

" Correction 24.46.103.28 ""The Munsters"" were not a relief of melodramtic soap operas such as ""Dark Shadows"" as the later series did not debut until 1966A.D. The only ""suspense"" soap opera that could have come close was ""The Edge of Night"". Rather, it was more a tongue-in-cheek send-up to the low-budget horror moviess perliferating in the fifties and sixties. The characters themselves bore this out, obviously! With sister-themed show ""The Addams Family"", and competitive sit-coms ""Bewitched"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie"", this formula became a winning mantra that departed from the typical family situation comedies, and droll western series! 24.46.103.28 Veryverser"

Editting geo-stubs I find it curious that you edited several of the additions I had made to several article exclusively in the direction of maintaining the regional (in this case Catalan) stub designation and not the national (in this case Spanish) designation. If they are both superfluous, why was not the regional one discared? Why did the national one always disappear? I don't see the harm in having both there. Many people may not necessarily know in which country Catalonia is. They have a better chance of knowing about a place if they know it is in Spain.
Shutters - Use of Socket Covers I have reverted the following edit under Shutters as it is in conflict with reference provided. An alternative view is that socket covers can prevent children plugging in faulty or dangerous appliances, as in the case of a child electorcuted (sic) when he plugged in a cable with a plug at one end and bare wires at the other. (The reference provides was: http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2011FAI17.html) The sheriff in the case concerned rejected the argument made because there was no supporting evidence, as is made clear in the document referenced.

=Strawpoll Hello Bethling. First of all, the city of Boston has 559,034 as stated on their page. Since the city of Boston only contains this number, this is the population they have, and the population, based on the city defined boundaries does not include all of the metro area. To include all of the metro area would mean including other cities than Boston in the equation, when those numbers do not belong to Boston. I will fix Austin, I just caught the mistake. Thanks.

That you (and other adtiors/administrators) have been so lax in blocking him for making non-NPOV edits to her articleonly goes to prove -again- that Wikipedia is nothing more than a media manipulated brainwashing machine.

Dougweller, you lied in this edit summary and you had clearly seen the discussion here, with Aoid insisting on the need for consensus before changing Aesop's Fables from the status quo to Mzilikazi's hijacked version. Therefore your edit was entirely inappropriate and for that reason I'm going to revert it. The block that you refer to was for using a 1-month-old consensus as the basis to protect an article from a gang of edit warriors. Whilst it's already fallacious due to the fact that it's entirely an ad hominem argument, it's even more dubious because you yourself are trying to use the discussion on this talk page as the basis to support Mzilikazi's illegal edits. If one reads the June 2012 discussion here, they'll see a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue. How is a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue justification for Mzilikazi's latest edit war when a 1-month-old consensus is apparently so worthless that I deserved to be blocked for implementing it? Besides, this talk page certainly wasn't the entire discussion; you're cherry-picking and you know it full well. In reality, Mzilikazi conceded defeat in the first edit war here, hence both Aesop and Aesop's Fables returned to their BC/AD state after 1.5 years of Mzilikazi bullying anyone who tried to undo his illegal changes. The status quo was protected for many months until Mzilikazi used his sock puppet Afkun to start a 2nd edit war 7 months later. Mzilikazi was the original and main trouble-maker on your side of the first edit war, Dougweller, so by completely ignoring his concession of defeat and cherry-picking evidence in an attempt to claim you won is outrageous and shows just how little value one should place on your thoughts here.

Actually, I never once made any inference on your motivesnot even inwardly. But since you've explicitly made one on mine, I guess that means yours are in question. Ok, so if what you are saying is that the operation was a victory for the Allies, why is that not a defeat for the Germans? Skinny87, that may be, but if I'm right, any source that lists Market-Garden as an Allied defeat implies a German victory.

Wow what a load of shit wiki is.... List of Filipino American Populations states and I quote Outside of California, one of the nations largest settlements of Filipino Americans is New York City, where nearly 60,000 Filipino Americans live. Within New York, the heaviest concentration is in the borough of Queens, with 32,843 members of the group. This article says 90,000. Some one fix this and find a real reliable source.
" Recognition of earlier superpowers Does recognition of earlier superpowers really need to be here since there is a page called Historical powers which talks about these countries pretty much the same way? It would take up way too much room to list all the historical powers which could be called ""Superpowers"" (A term used far too liberally) and would take the focus away from the United States, Soviet Union, and the [British Empire]] which were actually called superpowers. I think deleting the recognition of earlier superpowers and creating a link to Historical powers would much better and less confusing since none of these countries were ever called superpowers.

", 8 December 2015 (UTC) In know the way is generally confusing. Parks Canada generally consider a park created when a ""Land Transfer Agreement"" is signed with a province or a territory. Like for La Mauricie National Park, the agreement was made in 1970, but the park was etablished only in 1977. Maybe we should put note on the parks who are actually exist because of these agreements (Pukaskwa, Bruce Peninsula and Mealy Mountains). 01:12"

What Liars! Elonka, a liar who is now an administrator at Wikipedia after breaking every single rule this place has on behalf of Matt Sanchez, wrote the following: As regards Truthjustice, I agree with you that he's probably not Pwok directly at the keyboard, but it's still clearly a meatpuppet account, meaning an account that is acting on behalf of a banned editor, and is not participating at any other subject except the one that was in dispute. Hey idiot, this account was blocked almost immediately after I opened it. I didn't have time to participate in anything else. Instead of spouting bullshit, why not give the real reason for Wikipedia's actions? You harrassed my partner, telling him among other things that he was in love with Matt Sanchez. Then you lied about it. The reason I'm blocked here is because I'm partnered with a guy who blew the whistle on your little charade. He's going to keep right on doing it, too. What a pathetic bunch of losers you, JBBscribe and your friend Matt Sanchez are. Wikipedia is rapidly losing steam. If you want to know the reason, take a look in the mirror.

I know next to nothing about Australian politics. ) I have made a note at BLPN explaining the purpose of the section and also at the existing article to be sure that interested contributors have an opportunity to provide input. I do have to remind you, though, that if consensus is to create an article, you should do so very cautiously without implying guilt of anything on the part of this woman if guilt has not been legally determined. Again, we aren't here to take sides or have opinions. There are plenty of forums for that. We are here to create a scholarly reference work that neutrally represents previously published materials about subjects of enduring notability. (Wikilinks for added emphasis. I'm sure you've read these policies, but as you are walking in a controversial area, I really just wish to encourage extra caution.) No matter how hot fires are, Wikipedia is meant to remain cool.

I realize that several people (apparently including Rama) have attempted to point to Israel's bombing of Osiraq as the catalyst for Iraq's nuclear program, but it just does not hold up to scrutiny. Iraqi defectors as well as the IAEA's post Gulf War investigations found that Iraq had a clandestine program dating back to the late 1970's. Most of Iraq's nuclear work was done at Al Tuwaitha. Although the IAEA had access to Al Tuwaitha, it was extremely limited with the majority of the complex off limits to IAEA inspectors because no declared nuclear activity was taking place there. Evidently Blix saw nothing wrong with this. For the section quoting (although I did not include the quote to avoid POV) Blix praising Iraq compliance on the eve of the Invasion of Kuwait and during the beginning of Iraq's crash bomb program: NuclearFuel, August 20, 1990

Hahaha, wow that is the stupidest thing I've ever read. What the heck was the simulation based on ? Do you believe everything you read ? Haha, it looks like you do. You are an idiot if you believe that and it ignores evidence that proves humans evolved over 100,000 years ago. How could a European and Australian Aborigine have a recent common ancestor in that time frame if its already known that those people have been isolated in Australia for at least 30,000 years !!! I hope you are joking about this you loser, haha.

Yes, but your original edit ended up at the title you don't prefer, right? Anyway, I've moved to your title and merged the histories. I'll post to the talk page in a minute.
Are you going to teach me what language predominates in Catalonia and in the Basque country? Seriously? (I am Catalan of Basque descent). Catalan is spoken and understood (mainly because it's almost a dialect of Spanish, it is so similar) but Basque's situation is similar to the one of Irish, taught at school but only spoken commonly in remote areas. If you want further proof, check this referenced statement from the Spanish Wikipedia (article Catalua): El castellano es la lengua ms hablada de Catalua, superando al cataln no slo como lengua habitual,20 sino tambin como lengua materna18 y de identificacin,19 tanto en cifras relativas como absolutas..

I've done some cleanup, adding a mention of L as the series' main antagonist to the lead. I can't agree that the episode count is insignificant, given that what we're dealing with is how prominent the characters are to the story! More than that, I can't agree that L is absent from the second arc. Yes, he's dead, he's not physically present, but the characters refer to him constantly. His influence pervades the arc, as is shown by numerous quotes and so on. It's like saying Jesus has no relevance to Paul's epistles because he was dead at the time.
I WAS MERELY EXPRESSING AN OPINION.
But you can't customize the NPCs as you can customize the PCs for example. Why do you consider this to be a flaw? What is wrong with differentiating the 2 types of characters in your party?

Hi TallMagic. Thank you for your comments and help. I thought I gave reliable information by providing proper URL.

I honestly don't know how to put on those so-called on the images I put on pages. I just know how to put images just to make the page look good. Like most the images I put, the one of Dennis Orcollo and Lee Van Corteza come from a photo gallery from www.worldpoolchampionship.com (2004 edition). This means those pics are rather old and it's unlikely that they still have any copyright. 2004 is not rather old. Images published in the United States before 1923 are old. The images you uploaded are probably copyrighted. If the website you found them on does not explicitly say that the images are released under a free license or into the public domain, you have to consider them copyrighted and unavailable for use. You could consider emailing the photographer and asking them to release it under the GFDL, though. Take a look at this page Wikipedia:Image use policy, this page Wikipedia:Image copyright tags, and this page Wikipedia:Copyrights. Your images will probably be deleted unless you can show they are free to use. (Talk)

I think we clearly agree more than we disagree. Just to clarify my point, though, I feel that, for the very reason that we, indeed, do not want to speak authoritatively on a single proven cause, this is more than just saying explicitly up front that there are multiple theories. Whether our audience includes those touched by the affliction, or also those from the general public who want to learn more, we owe it to them not to give undue weight to observations that exist as isolated anecdotes in the literature, even the academically peer-reviewed literature. The academic peer-reviewed literature includes multiple review articles, and it would be better to shorten the page by largely deleting material that is not cited there.

The second is certainly wrong, as Zizang is a piece of written text in a latin alphabet, wheras Putonghua is a spoken language only, with no way of being represented in a latin alphabet without some form of transcription. Anybody know a better way of putting this.

Disambiguating two film that have the exact same title== The idea that one was shown on the Disney Channel and the other wasn't and one is therefore more relevant than the other is a pretty weak argument. You can't say for sure which one a given user would be more likely to search for. BTW, the 1981 version also won an award, if you'll check the article, but that, like the 2000 version's Emmy, is likewise irrelevant to this discussion. Also, each film has the exact same title; they need to be disambiguated, notredirected. ==

Correction to Karljoos Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok? Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south americas distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know. Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans dont view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture. As a result, I will add this fact to wikipedias anglo-saxon article. AND I WILL BACK THIS UP WITH GOOD SOURCES. So, I better not get idiot americans disputing this.

Did you hear that, everyone? Apparently ElKevbo thinks his 'well-informed' perception is a deciding factor in these matters. As long as he is convinced that something is widely perceived to be the case, apparently, for him, that's good to go, even if the vast majority of people have never even heard of the University of Chicago or LSE. But glancing over the personal websites of the likes of ElKevbo, Madcoverboy, and such, it looks like these 'well-informed' people may have had their fair share of rejections (in more ways than one), so perhaps we should give these guys a chance.

I'm going to agree with you that there are too many distinctions and that grey eyes are a form of blue and amber eyes are the lightest shade of brown however your theory of blue, green, hazel and brown being enough is incorrect as true hazel eyes are just simply a light golden brown (slightly darker than amber) and the definition you've given hazel eyes (green and brown) makes them fall under the green category. So I say there are only 3 true eye colors; blue, green and brown, the rest or significantly different shades/mixes of the 3.

It is said that someone close to Peter will die in this movie. And I am greatly sure it will be Betty, cuz it's official. Because in Spidy comics, She dies, and dies by the hands of Green Goblin. So Harry will have to be in this movie. What about Venom? In Spidy cartoon, one the old one, it's kinda like modern, the cartoon that sometimes have 3D buildings. In that cartoon, Spidey had the venom custome before, then abandoned it, and the venom came to Eddy Brook. I am thinking, the ending of this movie, might be Peter leaving the Venom suit, and the suit meeting up with Eddy, then Venom will appear in Spiderman 4 Sorry, if this is a spoiler:P I must be working for Sony Pictures;P 3 villians in this movie.w0w...3 hours long...like Lord of The rings:) "
Double Standard So, when someone accuses me of vandalism for posting information they don't like, that's ok. When I point out that it's censorship like found in 1940's Nazi Germany, you accuse ME of making a personal attack?

It's a crock of shit, and you know it.

Aegean Macedonians vs Greek Macedonians/Bulgarian Macedonians Hi Future, I want an explanation as to why the article Aegean Macedonians was forced into the article Slavic-speakers of Greek Macedonia, while Greek Macedonians and Bulgarian Macedonians get to have their own article instead of being within the article Macedonia (Greece) and Blagoevgrad Province respectfully? Aegean Macedonian is a subgroup just like Greek Macedonian, or Bulgarian Macedonian is. I believe Aegean Macedonian should have their own article if the other two subgroups are allowed too.

Becoming an admin I have a few questions for you that you might want to give some thought to before you nominate yourself as an admin. (1) Do you feel your love of licking balls would help you or hurt you as an administrator? (2) Would you be willing to accept an award for Wikipedia's Biggest Crybaby for running to WP:ANI, WP:RFCU, and WP:AIV every two minutes with every trivial complaint? (3) As Gwen Gale's official man servant, would you create articles about yourself and your terrible novel just like your master did? (4) Do you honestly believe that being Wikipedia's biggest drama queen will help you impress little boys in real life? (5) Are you willing to concede that you engage in sockpuppetry to get the attention on Wikipedia that you no longer get from daddy?
Are you really going to let that guy walk away scout free, because he's an admin, and block me because I was concerned about a conflict of interest? I want to take this up with ARBCOM. This is ridiculous.
Stub category names You keep saying that, but it flies in the face of facts on the ground in a large number of cases, and especially of all recent trends at SFR and /P. In fact, if I recall correctly, you seemed perfectly happy with a number of such renames yourself: dare I say, until it started to impinge upon the geo-stubs. Those aside, the number of cat names that aren't reasonable attributive usages (rather than necessarily adjectival, as I've pointed out more times than I care to remember) are not, I don't believe, as daunting as all that. What is completely demoralising is to get part-way, and then to discover someone insisting that the old way was best, let's go back to that. Actually, quite an apt summary of the moral lesson of Wikipedia in general.

" It is because ""the community"" decided they should be kept. It was voted on democratically, after all. Are you suggesting that democracy is an unrepentable evil? Fascist! Since troll metal is a description, not an actual subgenre, bands of internet trolls are allowed since they fit the description of ""troll metal"". If a band can be called ""troll metal"", then they belong under the umbrella of troll metal. Understand now? It takes maturity to understand that sometimes, some things are true simply because most people believe them.

" Answer: Thank you. - The allegiance that I corrected it to was the 'British Empire', not the UK. The ""Allegiance"" category in this section applies to Currie's military career, which his WW1 service was the centerpiece of. That conflict was a clash between the British Empire & the German Empire, not Canada vs Germany. Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters. It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

" I agree with your last statement totally! I grew up partically outside of the US in a non-white commonwealth nation, and realize how bad that myopic view many Americans have is. I assign most of the blame to the current US media obsession with targeting the lowest-common denominator of intelligence in entertainment and news programming. I haven't wathced Amercin network news programs intentionally in over 20 years, as they spend 22 minutes on expanded ""personal"" stories, with litte har ""American"" news coverage, much less anything else from the rest of the world! I grew up where you could turn on the radio at 3pm, and listen to an hour of BBC World Radio news coverage - now THAT was comprehensive. Don't know if they're still that way or not. Also, US government-run schools are atrocious, and spend little time on world events outside of America's di direct interaction, and currently most of that is in a purely negative light. So not only do they no nothing of the rest of the world, they think all the rest of the world's problems are our fault! I guess the fall of the various Eqyptian Empires was our fault since the US wasn't there to make it worse! - "

" My Two Cents Political correctness will be the end of our world as we know it. This is sad that political correctness has come to this level. It is causing our society to reward failure and condone criminal behavior. This is sad. We might as well change the constitution and exclude freedom of speech. This is next. Truly sad. Truly sad, indeed. Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made ""those people"" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes! And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct. Niggardly It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the ""controversial"" word ""niggardly"", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination. What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some ""idiots"" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!"

I am not sure if this comment is considered vandalism or not (it should be, in my opinion), but if you're just going to post garbage you should keep it within your own talkpage, instead of flaunting your stupidity accross Wikipedia and furthering the cause of groups like Prussian Blue by giving them the appearance of having intelligence in contrast to their opposition's constant use of personal attacks, POV, vandalism, and utter stupidity.

Music I changed the explanation of their style of music in the summary from just 'indie rock' to 'punk and reggae influenced britrock', just saying 'indie rock' seems meaningless and uninformative, -and they're not even on an independent record label any more. Maybe the influences could be expanded further, maybe cite influences such as 'the clash', does the article even mention that Mick Jones produced their album? I read this article and I have virtually no idea what kind of music this band plays. It's great that the front man makes a fool of himself constantly, but this is an article about a band, not an anti-heroin commercial. Could someone please write a few sentences about the music? Wow. I reread the article and realised you were entirely right. There wasn't even the usual description of style in the first sentence. I'll add something when I come up with something passable to say about it.
I think you are right. I have left a note for the editor that uploaded that image (w:Commons:User talk:Yikrazuul). I expect that he should be able to correctly it promptly, and if not I will upload a replacement. Thanks for catching the error and letting me know. (Edgar181)

Denial of rollback Well, rollback is for reverting vandalism/blatant spam only, and not for reverting good-faith edits or for use in content disputes/revert wars. The best thing to do would either be to wait for a month or two, and re-apply then; or, I could grant it to you now, but only if I have your guarantee that you'll use rollback for reverting vandalism, and that you understand it's for that use. Remember that rollback can be removed as easily as it can be given.
What a sham. HAHAHAHA. HAHAHAHA. This is so funny. That poor guy is totally flustered and confused. So, I am just gonna let him go. lol. I doubt if he is in a state to understand anything anymore. It will only confuse him further. lol. He actually inadvertently helped me. lol. I wanted to close those superflous accounts anyway. LOL. The admins involved are misinformed and confused too, policy understanding and applicability went for a toss, even when the policy is quite explicit. But never mind them. lol. I guess, they cant be expected to spend their time to go thru ALL messages carefully to really and actually understand a situation, so they just act willy-nilly and haphazardly. BTW, If that guy calls me a Vandal, then I WILL call and consider him a TROLL. And he knows that. lol. Perhaps I should have followed the policy of not feeding the troll. lol. He started the issue. Why does he get so worked up then? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. He cant take it? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. LOL. Anyway, Sue, I am gonna be quite busy. Important stuff coming up. I am really going to enjoy. Will log in only after quite a while. Have a few ideas which can change the technical and general policy of wiki in a very fundamental way. Will have to chat with the concerned guy at wiki. Anyway, you too have fun Sue. Enjoy. HAHAHAHAHAHA. That guy sure amused me muchly. LOL. HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA. Bye.

" So Jim Burton, child molesting faggot, I see you are still with us for yet another day, making a total buffoon out of yourself as usual. I don't know what is sadder here - you, or the extreme hypocritical arrogance you show by lecturing the world about ""ethical principles"" for your claimed ""rights"" to abuse our children. You have no ethical principles to save your life, but it's exactly as the Roman poet said, isn't it? ""the harlot doth always rebuke the chaste.""

Your argument becomes even weaker if you're now going to rely upon your hopes and wishes that the subject has 'moved on'. It is clear that the person had psychiatric problems as a result of this episode, and that any reasonable person might deduce that such problems might be perpetuated and compounded by the digged determination to print the victim's name. Your 'genie in the bottle' analogy again ignores the points that have been made to you above; just because another publication prints his name doesn't mean WP has to, particularly as WP is more likely to be first port of call for anyone searching for information on the video. As for your hope that the article serves as a cautionary tale - how is the inclusion of his name going to further that 'hope'? Finally, you doidn't answer the question I posed, which in my opinion is the nub: 'perhaps you might put yourself in his shoes for one moment, and then ask yourself whether your determination to include what most agree is a non-essential detail has the potential to cause yet more hurt and upset to the victim here?'
" Reply to JJ, The nature of his edits are not merely disruptive but fundamentally vandalism. Arlok has removed content that does not please his POV citing nonsensical excuses like 'terrorism' and 'Union of India' etc. which is an intolerable behavior here at Wikipedia. Since He was the one who had removed all of/a large portion of edits unwarranted for, without citing proper explanation, I have had his edits reverted and he had been warned. Unless, you get a reasonable explanation from him on the 4 edits I have mentioned above, there is no point calling this edit-warring as its a clear-cut case of vandalism. He is apparently new, and He needs to familiarize himself with the Core Policies(or look closer at his edits, perhaps you may see he is just another POV Pusher who is good to kick the bucket from the project), I reckon you understand.

It should, but, quite frankly, the media in general isn't interested in the Clearways Project - its much easier (and it sells more papers) to write about how 'shocking' CityRail is. Thus it's either Liberal sources or Labor sources (which would be more accurate, but would have a POV aswell), and I would assume that the CityRail website on the project has a slant towards Labor; thus presenting two sides to the story. Oh, BTW - budget overruns by governments (doesn't matter which party is in power) is pretty much the norm' anyway )

Your ignorance disturbs me. I am not just some 'guy', and if I were not professionally trained in history, I would not continue on arguing with you. But you will agree that we are all humans, on the internet. I was pointing out the absurdity of that statement. And Adam, if I were trolling you, I would be stupid in the field of the Crusades, which I am not. I have no desire to piss you off. If I am insulting you, please let your rage out on my user talk page. Silverwhistle, I couldn't care less how much you like Conrad, but you have no need to defend him. I still think he was a jerk. Besides, if he never came to Tyre, Saladin would have spared the population and probably 100 years of bloodshed, and perhaps the gay crusade, would never have taken place. Perhaps a thousand years of bloodshed would never have taken place. It was unfortunate that Guy of Lusignan was weak enough to listen to Reynald, but Conrad's interference only intensified the conflict. I suggest we get back on the topic of Humphrey and how we can better this article. Again, please take this to my user page if you truly hate my guts.

"::Nice wording there. That's the point. It's a fact. It's not a ""portrayal"" that is ""too positive"". It's a fucking FACT. What planet is this? Where does this argument come from? IT IS A FACT. It matters not what editors of this encyclopedia think. It matters greatly what the sources state. And they state it explicitly: ""Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time"", ""By acclamation Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all-time"". How much more explicit do you expect it to get? They aren't going to waltz the answer out to you. This is an objective look at someone who demonstrably showed that they were the greatest. If editing is a problem, then just create a special lock or something for the opening paragraph that only the top moderators can unlock. Every source in existence acknowledges him as #1 all-time. So the idea of ""having certain wording"" that may not object to certain users' opinions completely defeats the purpose of an ENCYCLOPEDIA. "

" I would say no. But I might have to change my mind if you can find it in a reputable source, other than a typo. I first found it in the Lisp 1.5 Programmer's manual, there both boolean and boolian are used. Searching google shows that both are in use. Other two links where both spellings are used: Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics, A catalogue and guide to the Charles S. Peirce Papers ""boolean"" or ""Boolean"" I believe that the spelling of ""boolean"" should be standardized to be de-capitalized when used in a sentence. Example: Boolean algebra simplifies circuits. However, they are expressed in boolean expression. The word ""boolean"" appears to be derived from the person's name George Boole, and just like ""diesel"" is derived from the person Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel, ""volt"" from the person Volta, and so on. Well, language isn't always as neatly regular as you might like it to be. The standard usage in mathematics has a capital B, therefore we use a capital B. In computer science, sometimes it's lowercase, and that's OK too. "

"??? Mr. THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUS n KNOWN TO EVERYBODY THAT WHY PURE KSHATRIYA RACES GURJARAS,MEENAS,MARATHAS NEVER MARRIES RAJPUTS because Though the word ""Rajput"" is supposed to be a corrupted form of the Sanskrit word 'Raajaputra' which means a ""scion of the royal blood"" and that the word occurs in the Puranas and also in the Harshcharita of Bana, Mahajan is honest enough to accept that the word, in earlier times and in some areas even now, had an disrespectful meaning. The Vedic Rajas & old Kshatriyas(tribals),not satisfied with their married wives,had frequently children by their female slaves,who although not legitimate successors to the throne,these illegitimate children were styled Rajpoots,or the children of Rajas""The word ""Rajput"" is used in certain parts of Rajasthan to denote the illegitimate sons of a Kshatriya chief or Zamidar."" [Mahajan: 1972: 550 ff.] The conclusion is obvious that they were not considered by the original residentsto be respectable, to start with. This is because ""Raaja"" means royal but ""Raj"" means semen. The progeny of mixed marriages is even now called by that name in some parts. The condition of woman was deteriorating. The question of women education was unthinkable. Obscene Art flourished during Rajput age. The originality of the ancient times was lost and the ancient culture degenerated. The country fell into the hands of Rajput barons, soon to be followed by the Mohammedan invaders who completed the work of annihilation.

Move to Real Madrid CF Hi, as all articles of football clubs has their default names without the periods (full stops) in the initials of the words less representative of the full name, I think the article should move to Real Madrid CF, so Real Madrid C.F.'s article name is the sole exception of all clubs in terms of nomenclature I've seen so far. I think the change should be done very carefully because I'm sure that must be a lot of articles that refer to Real Madrid C.F. (current name). It's for this reason that I propose to make a bot for that when someone agrees to change the name, the bot will change the link in all articles which refer to this article. - 00:02, 11 December 2010 (CET)

RFA closure Hello Mabdul, I'm sorry to inform you that I have closed your RFA as unsuccessful. I arrived at this result based on community concerns related to your activities on IRC and during April 1st. People felt that actions you took in those settings evidenced immaturity and were likely to conflict with the expectations the community has for administrators to be capable of complex and sensitive discretionary decisions. However, I should also note that many commentors did view your administrative potential positively and there was overwhelming approval of your contributions to the project as an editor. I would suggest that your review the feedback in the RFA and consider running in some months after reflection on how you can better handle borderline situations that could result in controversy. Thank you again for your edits to the project. '''''' talk

It was common knowledge throughout the 18th & 19th Century that the Rothschild family owned most of everything - so much so in fact that it was known as the Age of the Rothschilds among historians. Try doing some independent research all of your own and you'll soon see that the ""conspiracy theories"" about the BoE being privately owned are in fact rooted in historical fact - history which was not so long ago common knowledge.

I'm of the opinion that its best to keep things simple, ie. KISS principle, this is far better than over complicating what is a fairly good article with some poorly thought out (but referenced) additions. Looking at your previous edits on Elvis Presley and the fact you have caused many problems on this article, see, Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Onefortyone#Onefortyone_placed_on_Probation for an example. I hope you have not moved over to a lesser article to avoid detection and cause further problems. Lets add some real value, not just content. I dont think anyone really wants to see this article degenerate into another Soap box for your points of view.

" Pope Benedict offered his ""warmest good wishes and prayers"" for the bishops and all the faithful entrusted to their care. He urged them warmly to welcome disaffected Anglicans who wanted to join the Catholic Church. It has offered Anglicans the prospect of their own hierarchies - ordinariates - within the Catholic system, leading to predictions that whole congregations opposed to plans for women bishops may transfer from the Church of England."

As for the denialism = skepticism claim, you're wrong, you don't have a source: ""Wikipedia articles (or Wikipedia mirrors) are not reliable sources for any purpose."" I expect the Denial article has made assertions that denialism = skepticism, but know that for some living persons the majority of reliable sources say that's false. So, since this redirect would automatically cause a new contention about living persons by causing existing ""skepticism"" links to go to ""denial"", it needs a lot more caution than whatever has been dumped in the Denial article.

" Dumb question? Would the repeal of withholding, via Constitutional amendment, apply only to Fed income taxes? That is to say, would the States be bound to repeal withholding as well, since they are the ones necessarily ratifying it in the first place? I may have missed it inside the article (which is very good indeed) and if I did I apologize, but it seems to me that once the repeal of withholding becomes an established fact, a great deal of political power passes from the politicians back to the consumer. Simply put, a dollar represents a unit of freedom. And if the phrase ""a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" has any truth to it at all, it means political power is being leveraged, indeed heavily back to the consumer/producer for every dollar he keeps. That is an extremely compelling argument, it seems, though hardly ever mentioned. Regards. 155.188.183.6 "

It isn't. Both aren't even theories, but products of simpleton invention without basis and are completely undoubtedly incorrect. I favor none. I delete(d) them both, because AFAIK there are none sources at all on this issue. The House of Saint Vladimir is of descent from a Travunian local noble house, with doubtable links to the House of Trpimirovic and most surely no link to the House of Viseslavic. However, I must object putting it as a separate line - Tvrtko asserted rule and his line (Tvrtkovic) is historically considered the main line of the Kotromanics. As for the Trpimirovic branches, I suggest following standard historical interpretation of the Svetoslavic being a cadet branch, whereas the other being the simple continuation of the standard Trpimirovic line (Kresimirovic)?

if they destroy each other they both don't live up to it. irresistable force means nothing can stop it. immovable means the object can't be moved. in both cases beign destroyed contradicts that. something like that means it was a powerful force meeting an equally resistant object. the problem is the adjectives that are absolute. just like the god examples and the greek dog. god can't be absolute if he can't do everything. creating something he can't oppose is something so if he can't do it he isn't absolute but then if he can then he isn't abosolute because he can't oppose it and so can't do everything. Laelaps was a dog that always gets what it hunts but Jupiter turned it into a static star while it was hunting a fox. since it can't ever move again it can't ever catch the fox and so it doesn't always get what it hunts.

User Conduct RfC Vs. Dicklyon I have taken the action of filing a user conduct RfC against Dicklyon based on his past and recent behavior. If you want to make your POV on this matter known please do. Users are needed to certify that the events as I presented them are factual, and they have to certify that outside help has been sought to address the issue. I have written this to every involved user in the mediation. Since Dick has proven that he will ignore any mediated arrangement when it suits him. The community must impose one on him. The proper venue for that is a user conduct RfC, not mediation. The proposed sanctions banning for editing any of the name space of the articles listed in the mediation, and from the user pages of any user who wishes to not have to deal with his mess any more.

" Ed, we all have our biases, you and me both. My concern about the article is that it needs to cover a lot of bases. Broadly speaking, to be fair to all parties concerned, let's acknowledge that a) damaging quotations are a part and parcel of partisan politics, b) there is debate about whether and when such quotations are legitimate, because c) some can be taken out of context, while d) different politicians exhibit different speaking styles and such styles can be the source of parody and such parodies are often based on at least some degree of truth, and e) sometimes politicians really are dumbasses. Taken in a broader context, that is how artististic political characaturists and comic impressionists make their living. Did Carter really smile broadly and instantly? Did Ronald Reagan really say ""Well"" at the beginning of sentences? Where would we be without Dana Carvey and Rich Little? Obviously, this is an issue that both you and I feel strongly about. Perhaps our biases just clash. Maybe we need other people to delve into the articles and try to write something from a perspective that is neither yours nor mine. "
. According to TV (History Channel? NOVA?) the stove impacts us little today, and is not important. The stove is difficult to make work correctly. The complicated flue will back smoke into the room if not operated just right. As a result, the design was never popular, even in Franklin's time, and quickly fell into disuse. I dunno if there's a connection between the Franklin Stove and box-shaped fire boxes used today. I don't recall any mention of the fact on the TV special.

OK. I am not going to diss. with you anymore. Because, you are an hopless nationalist. Besides, there are no Ottoman sources that shows 20 thousand deaths.

I don't need to provide anything, i am asking (as i did on the article but my edit was reverted) for a source that macroevolution has been observed. The article claims macro has been observed but contains no source for this claim. Evidently the article is biased and was written by an evolutionist who is incorrectly presenting macroevolution as science, when in actual fact its never been observed.
Image question In addition to everything I have been doing lately, i'm also trying to clear up some theatre image copyrights and such. I have noticed a number of images that are loaded to both Wikipedia and the Commons. When this occurs, isn't it usually common to delete the image on Wikipedia in favour of the Commons images or did I dream that? Thanks, as always! P.S. I just finished reading your ballon article. How marvelous it is and so wonderfully illustrated! You are truly a valuable asset to Wikipedia and all of us who dwell in ivory towers. | Dialogue?

" Oppose. The sources in the article tend to prefer Podolia for the region even though they use Kamanie (et al.) for the city. Pitcher's Historical Geography of the Ottoman Empire also uses Podolia with no mention of Kamanie (et al.). The proposed title matches neither the Turkish nor the English name of the city.

" Plot I changed this is a highly fictionalised account of Thompson and attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta's actual trip to Las Vegas around the same time period. This is contracticed many times through out the article. In one instance, under the Pre production sub heading it says: Depp remembers, ""He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse. Later on under the sub heading Reaction, it says: Apparently it all came flooding back to him, he was reliving the whole trip! He was yelling out and jumping on his seat like it was a rollercoaster, ducking and diving, shouting 'SHIT! LOOK OUT! GODDAM BATS!' That was fantastic if he thought we'd captured it, then we must have done it. Although it is a far fetched story, it is not highly fictionalised and regardless, it can't say it is if there are statements throughout the rest of the article from direct sources that are saying it is real.

" hi....I just had read what you wrote on my talk page, and this was my response back: Fair enough, but then instead of just removing the whole thing, why didn't you just change what I wrote to ""different genuses"" then? (As far as my ""tone"", to be honest you seemed to have a ""tone"" in your edit reason where you removed my whole edit. And you seemed annoyed, so I was just wondering why the seeming attitude.) But yeah, why couldn't you have altered what I wrote instead of removing the whole thing? That's what I'm kind of curious about. Because my over-arching point (which IS true) is that cougars are technically not ""lions"", and some people have asked about that. So couldn't you maybe just modify what I wrote, instead of completely removing it? "

Hi CTL,good to hear from you. You, me & Srikanth have had several discussions across a range of topics but i don't recall we have cut each others work. We have basically agreed to disagree while maintaining facts & opinions separate from each other. Ofcourse i have made deletions but i have tried and later on as i have learned the ropes given reasons for what i have done. Do me a favour,go to Surat Railway station & Mumbai Rajdhani's pages and compare the image. I cant figure out how the same images shows Mumbai Central & Surat station as being identical right down to the background but a certain individual does claim that i am wrong. Thanks for the word of support, i was beginning to feel alone in the fight. All the images i have uploaded is through commons & all the images have been taken by me so there are no copyright issues anywhere.

I came here to ask the same question. Their use seems to be widespread, but it's impossible to say now whether these are simply picking up on their use here. They do not appear on the sites of the BBC, the Radio Time, or Neal Street Productions, and they are not being used on the 1st series DVD, or the BBC iPlayer. The fact that they only appear to have been added (here and on the main CtM page) after the episodes screened also rings alarm bells. I am therefore going to delete them until someone can come up with an official source that endorses them.

A message to newyorkbrad Great. You and your stuck up friends at arbcom are blocking established editors based on a few edits. May I kindly suggest that you go dig yourself a hole and cry for the rest of your life.
That's a rather feeble premise to argue showing an excessive number of photos prominently showing 24 different women's vaginas, compared to one human male penis 3/4 of the way down the page on the equivalent article for male genitalia. This demonstrates the overwhelming male bias in editorial content on Wikipedia. 86.13.182.103

" Image Tagging Image:Erk.jpg This media may be deleted. Thanks for uploading Image:Erk.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is therefore unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page. If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then you can use to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, please read fair use, and then use a tag such as or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use. If you have uploaded other media, please check that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the ""my contributions"" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting ""Image"" from the dropdown box. Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. Thank you. "
I was motivated to add value to articles. Then a cadre of fascist, self-important, imperious, asinine pricks took it upon themselves to systematically target my contributions, which were well withing guidelines and certainly along the lines of the 1000's of cultural references in Simpson's articles. They reverted my contributions, deleted my hard work, gang edited my stuff, refused to compromise or in any way work for anything but their own dictatorial will. Now I'm motivated to be as asinine and ignorant as they are. I'm wholesale deleting anything without a source or reference. I'm disallowing references I personally feel are insufficient. Every article locked I feel is a victory, because it diminishes Wikipedia to lock articles, and its due to their actions that they are locked, so I feel vindicated. Leave all the messages you like, I doubt I'll get them because I use proxies and different IPs so I can do my good work without hindrance. A hearty fuck you to yourself and any other of your cocksucking brethren, faggot. Eat shit and die. Get cancer. I hope your kids and your wife and your immediate family the worst possible life, as if living with pricks like you and your buddies is not bad enough, then to die horribly and in pain. Thanks! f.u. asshole

Comment. Another possibility is to merge with Versechorus form and use that as the title. While that's a larger change, it has two advantages: a shorter article title, and neutrality regarding whether this form defines popular music (or vice versa).

" Hello again. I'll respond to your note on my page a little here. First of all, I don't have a negative attitude towards the Romans, or the Greeks, or the Macedonians or anyone from Western antiquity. I'm really not that interested in Classical history beyond basic knowledge. What I AM interested in is keeping the wiki clean. As far as having the article locked, it was put into what's called ""semi-protected"" mode. In semi-protect, anonymous users cannot edit the article, and neither can newly registered accounts. This is to prevent vandalism from occuring - people putting in nonsense or swearing for no reason, that kind of thing. By the time you read this note you should have had your account long enough that you can now edit the article. I will warn you that trying to put in uncited material or stuff that goes against the manual of style will probably be deleted again, although not by me. Another suggestion would be to use the Apollo discussion page to air your concerns. Two of the five wikiprojects that have staked a claim on Apollo ( Wikiproject Classical Greece and Rome and Wikiproject Mythology) are known for their accuracy and attention to detail. They can probably give you reasons for why the content looks like it does. One last note, if you want to leave me a message again, please to it here at this link to my talk page, rather than on my main user page. That way I get a note telling me you want to talk to me, rather than having to wait until I stumble across your posting. Either way, good luck. talk "

" Incendiary In the lead, the word incendiary is attributed to Beck via critics, but in this Financial Times piece, Beck is described as incendiary: ""But on Saturday, exactly 47 years after Mr King gave his legendary 'I have a dream' speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC, the incendiary Fox News host and the former Alaska governor will host a rally there aimed at 'restoring honour' to America."" It appears incendiary is not applied to Beck only by defined critics. - "
" ""Self-hating Jew"" is with very rare exception used as an epithet only. It is very rarely used to legitimately describe an actual condition. I can cite thousands of instances of its use as an epithet; I suspect that one would be hard-pressed to come up with even a dozen examples of its legitimate use. Jfdwolff changed the introduction to include the word ""epithet,"" so maybe NPOV is not what you think it is in this case. I understand that there is a history of Jews hiding or otherwise denying or betraying their ethnicity/religion. But ""self-hating Jew"" is hardly a sympathetic term to describe such a person. Even by Prof. Gilman's position as given in the article, the term arose out of a dispute between different Jewish groups: an epithet. If you met someone who was genuinely distressed about his Jewish identity to the point that he tried to hide or deny it, would you call him a self-hating Jew? I think that would be very cruel; something worse even than calling a handicapped person a ""cripple."" I also believe that most reasonable people would agree that your revert was belligerent and blind, given complete information. And I think describing someone's edit as ""POVing,"" as you did, is fairly characterized as a personal attack. Other than a few editors connected in various ways with you, I have had little trouble getting cooperation from anyone on Wikipedia, but thank you for your advice. "

" Idiot Thank you for calling me an idiot in your edit summary. Lovely. More importantly: ({{PROMUSICAE]]) You changed formats. One usually doesn't change formats, especially in GAs. You removed a ref that was to the official site and where it was available online are replaced it with a book. I do relise that when a revert happens, a person gets a notice. I was hoping you would spot the obvious error (#1) atleast, but alas, you bark out idiot. I haven't clue why you did this as there was no reason. I just fixed Angel (Madonna song). First of all, try to understand why it was done. Did you open this reference and see whether Angel is present here at all or not? Guess not. Second of all, the book reference is the one to be used, PROMUSICAE be damned or not. Thirdly, hung medien is NOT the official site for old song in Spain, they post from 2004 onwards. And using both the book as well as the template with the same reference name as ""spain"" gives a reference error. And ""One usually doesn't change formats, especially in GAs"" is not a reason for keeping errorneous false templates. [ ChitChat ] "

Cabalist team of sysops/users undermines WPs reliability promoting Greek nationalistic POV A well collaborated group of 3 WP sysops and 8 WP users has been spotted working systematically in full daily basis to promote ultra natioanalistic Greek POV. They intervene in any related new articles, make Greek POV edits, edit wars, reverts, deletions, block users, merges and redirects. Their main target is political articles about Rebublic of Macedonia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania, their minorities in Greece and Greek history. Khoikhoi (sysop) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (sysop) recently deleted article: Voden inscription, and protected articles as Minorities in Greece and Bulgarian Human Rights in Macedonia. They also redirected new articles as Bulgarian minority in Greece to Minorities of Greece, Bulgarians in Greece to Minorities in Greece and Tarlis incident to Treaty of Sevres without warning and discussion. All redirects dont allow traces . Practically this action is equivalent to speady deletion because redirected articles are not included to target articles and prevents recreating them under same name.

I agree with the sentiment of this editor that Arcayne called an AssClown. You've already filed a checkuser, read the result and thanked the admin that ran the check. For you to insinuate that two separate authors are one AFTER BEING TOLD that you are wrong - is the absolute height of lacking good faith. I am also shocked to see you complain about the other editor after you have so brazenly stalked and reverted my edits in the past, indeed you even followed me here to harass and stalk me in Fitna months ago after I made an edit in Scarlet Pimpernel that you disliked. And yes, since you seem to always run a checkuser against me and whatever editor opposes you here and they always come back negative yet you still make the same baseless charge and attack you are operating without Good Faith and have a private agenda, one that is not in keeping with the selfless NPOV standards of Wikipedia. You need to go to a quiet place and think about how others view your bullying selfish petty distortions. 75.49.223.52

Why doesn't someone that knows how to edit, SEARCH THE WEB and put in the article THE FACT that 25,000 volts from a stun gun, administered twice, will 100% neutralized the poison and REMOVE the pain within seconds. This knowledge has been on the Internet over ten years. There were quite a few doctors who were promoting it but apparently the AMA put a stop to that. Look at this. The medical profession HAS NO REMEDY and will charge a person THOUSANDS of dollars for treatment, and WILL NOT TELL THEM about stun guns, which WILL eliminate the problem IMMEDIATELY. The public deserves to know this and you guys that edit can EASILY find this information.76.6.94.150
Bill, we also have a policy called WP:BOLD. You do not have to wait for any particular person to approve your edit before you make them. You could go ahead with your edit if you want. And if you want to discuss the reliability of the source which you propose, here is one thing to consider. Is the source an academic, I mean a professor? If the person who wrote the book is a professor, there is a reasonable chance that the source may be OK. I have not reviewed it though. There can be issues even if the source be a professor. I think you can go ahead though. If there are objections, they can be discussed later too.-

A Warning About Racist Amandajm Amandajm has repeatedly made so many racist comments about certain europeans on the Castle article that I sent a complaint to wiki editors. This person is extremely inflexible when other people trg to correct info on the Castle article. When attempts about updating history about Spaniards and italians were made on the Castile article, Amandajm did not allow such edits. Such stubbborness is considered racist. He refuses to acknowledge certain european history and contribution. I ask that others watch this person since he is deceptive. If any of you have experienced similar action by Amandajm, it is strongly recommended that you voice your concerns about his racism to wiki.

Ed, I am tired! Anyway, I certainly did not mean to trivialize the suffering of vicitms of racism, only to say that most scientists racist and anti-racist have not been persecuted the way Galileo was. Perhaps racist scientists should be. But even here I would qualify it not only do I not want to put some racist scientists in the US or Canada in the same category of Joseph Mengele, I think the crucial difference is precisely the social context we live in a society based on free debate where a few scientists can be racist and they will be challenged publically and a well-informed public can make up its mind. In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things. But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

proposal to create a separate Elverson Building article When the Inquirer was in the Elverson Building, its longtime home at Broad and Callowhill, it was understandable for Wikipedia to have a single article covering both the newspaper and the building (though, in my opinion, it would also have been fine to have separate articles as, for instance Comcast and its building do). Now that the newspaper and the building have parted ways, it's time for the Wikipedia content to do likewise. This would allow the geographic coordinates of the Philadelphia Inquirer article to show the location of the Philadelphia Inquirer, rather than that of the building that formerly housed it.

Although possibly aggravated by his well renowned poor memory for the names of other editors he interacts with, as you saw when you corrected him about his claim you always start ANI threads, he just ignored you and instead upped the ante, referring to your ""obvious campaign of harassment"" of him. A clear personal attack if ever there was one. He's done it with this 'reformed' account many times already, he did it when he was socking on his 'roommate' account, and he did it when he was just plain old Malleus the b/tard. It's ironic this behaviour is the same sort of bullying he often accused admins of doing. And with no hint of irony at all from him, he accused you of trying to demean and patronise him, even though that's basically how he treats anyone on Wikipedia he doesn't agree with.

Vandalizing Macedonian towns Glenn, first of all the Freestylefrappe is not TERSELY saying, he has already blocked me without any warning. Have you seen his version of Kumanovo article? He is talking only about murdering, blood, terrorism and nothing about the city normal life. Of course, there were moments in the Kumanovos history when a terrorist attacks took place, but Kumanovo is most of the time a quiet ordinary Macedonian town that doesnt deserve such descriptions. It is the same as if you write an article about London not mentioning St Pauls catedral, Westminster, Tower bridge.. and writing only about recent terrorist attacks in the London underground. Talking about copyvios, I noticed that FreeStyleFrappe is using text written by Christopher Deliso You can check that on: http://www.serbianna.com/columns/deliso/ http://www.popovashapka.com/terrorist_bombing_in_kumanovo.htm Are you sure he has permit for doing that? Of course, I will not stay calm until he stops vandalizing the Macedonian towns.

" False statements This is a false statement: ""Russia is offering full cooperation to Polish prosecutors during the investigation.[52] Polish investigators in Russia have been given access to all procedures of Russian investigators. They do not have the authority to conduct investigative actions by themselves, but they are participating on equal terms with their Russian counterparts in the interviews with people involved and other parts of the investigation. Polish officials are to secure all Polish state documents found in the wreckage, as well as electronic devices (portable computers and mobile telephones) belonging to government officials and military officers. In turn Russian investigators received from Poland materials secured after the crash, including those about the technical state of the airplane and fitness of the pilot. "" please change it."

Al Arabiya Reply to your post: Please do not mark edits as minor unless they are truly minor and could not possibly be the source of dispute. Reverting an edit is virtually never minor (unless reverting clear vandalism). As for the reversion itself, the content is clearly a violation of POV. Even if the comment were to be qualified, the source fails WP:RS and is itself a violation of NPOV to include in the article. The content is not violation of POV and your edits appear to constitute vandalism.

I'd say that if the location is in Romania, the Romanian name should occur first, with the Hungarian name second (option 1). Similar to how the name of the Dutch city of Leeuwarden is treated in that article. The city is in the Netherlands, so its Dutch name is given and is the article title. It is the capital of the province of Friesland, so its name in Stadtsfries (a dialect) and West Frisian (a recognised provincial language) are also given.

OK, I understand the confusion now. Moiety payments for revenue officers (tax collectors) were stopped in 1871 or 1872, but for customs officers weren't stopped until the Anti-Moiety Act of 1874. Two separate laws, two separate groups of federal employees. I'll sort it out in the article, and write some more about Curtis and the Civil Service Commission. Calling Chester Arthur a reformer is ... generous. But we needn't fight over that, since it's beyond the scope of this article.

Dude, what I will admit to is that I post things to see if they are trivial or not, depending on whether or not they last. I've had entire articles deleted because of a lack of notability, despite the fact I spent hours on them, and gave great sources. A good example is my article on list of video game slang. Just because I put something there doesn't mean it isn't trivial. Unless your name is Jesus, you're bound to mistakes, and even hypocrisy.

Because of ignorant scumbags such as yourself, North Africa may very well one day disappear.

" Response. I find it somewhat ironic that you're criticizing me for taking the exact actions you took. I noticed a page which I honestly felt (and still do) does not meet any of the 12 pts. in WP:MUSIC. I have no interest in their music or their entry. I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion. When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny. If the consensus was that they met notability standards (beyond your simple assertion that they did) then the articles would have withstood review. I even offered to change my opinion if you could demonstrate notability. Last I heard, ""because WebHamster"" says so is not a reliable independent source that i am aware of, nor is that stated anywhere on in WP. (note: You'll notice that I took no action on Mo Foster - because a quick search revealed the at least a prima facia notability, which The Hamsters could not assert) "

By the way it is very simple: USA violated the Iranian territorial waters. USA has bombed Iranian territory. This makes the USA a direct combatant.
":: I think the problem might be the unnecessarily mathematical description ""up to an additional 24N nautical miles beyond the territorial sea, where the territorial sea is N nautical miles wide, N12"". If you were just skimming over the article, it would be easy to misread that the 24-N as 24N (i.e. 24 nautical miles). Unless anyone objects, I'll change this to a more plain-English description, such as ""A Contiguous Zone extends from the limit of the territorial sea, up to a distance of 24 nautical miles from the baseline"", possibly also adding ""In cases where the country in question has claimed less than 12nm for its territorial waters, its contiguous zone may therefore be more than 12nm wide"". Unless it has already been added (and I have just missed it), it needs to be mentioned that when territorial/contiguous zones belonging to different countries intersect, then the median line is taken as the boundary.

" This is ridiculous. Aside from the reference not actually calling it a war crime, saying that ""some"" characterize it as one doesn't make it one. War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war. The key words here are ""laws"" and ""war."" Unless one lives in a corrupt town, laws are made by legislatures, or in this case ratified by them, after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their military's generals. The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process. The laws of war were not written by corrupt and ignorant peaceniks sitting around dreaming up what they think would be moral. I'm deleting this section. It's not salvageable. "

" Andrey Kashechkin photo? Hi - I just edited Andrey Kashechkin to include an image in the infobox, and it's of him in Astana team colors, but is a six-year old image! There are, I think, five images of ""Kash"" in wikimedia commons we could draw on: the one Astana shot and then four Lampre pics. The Lampre ones are higher-resolution and one of them is quite well-composed imo, but of course Kash no ride for dem nomore! Can you help me discover consensus: should we use the old Astana image, or a nicer, newer Lampre image, even though he's not on Lampre anymore? Let me know your thoughts! Grazie! x2 "
You know what the fun thing about Wikipedia is? You can act like your a mod, no matter who you are, so if you get your IP blocked, who cares, just go to another computer!
It's noteworthy but I don't think it merits its own article. But it has made national news, covered by CBS and NBC among several newspapers. Moving it a list of Internet memes is probably the thing to do.

Hey there, I deleted the section about refinancing types because that was content I added originally, and after speaking with Kuru, I decided to take my information down as it wasn't from a reliable source. It is my own content from a personal weblog which he deemed inappropriate for Wikipedia. Thanks.

" No, what you said before was that the term ""is not used in Ireland"". You're now admitting it is used - if rarely (I happen to agree with you there!). Government policy doesn't cover geography. And as demonstrated, government policy doesn't appear to cover FF senators and TDs (but then, that's not new...). AFAICR, the Dept of Education essentially said ""Not our problem"" when a teacher (?) complained to them about Folens using the BI term in its atlas and told the complainant to get in touch with the publishers directly. To me, what smacks of a post-colonial inferiority complex is the drive by a vocal minority to expunge the term from every Irish-related article. I rarely if ever use the term myself in everyday life (I prefer Ireland and Britain or Britain and Ireland), but if it does get used - meh! Big deal! I don't think it as a conspiracy to undermine sovereign Ireland, put us down, offend us, somehow claim our territory or subsume us back into the union, the way some people on here seem to take it. Britain and Ireland, though, isn't a geographical term - its two different islands! I'd rather just say the Shannon is the longest river in Ireland than the longest in B & I - though my preference would still be to use the worldwide common name for the island group.

They got CONQUERED BY WHITE SPANIARDS aka TRUE HISPANICS and that is the reason non-White, RED Mexicans are HISPANOPHONES, they're not Hispanics (FROM SPAIN IS THE TRUE DEFINITION OF HISPANIC!!), they are Mayans or Aztecs or whatever tribe. The native people of Spain, are White! Maybe, since retarded yanks can't grasp these FACTS, them Mexicans ought to be shamed for their defeated, loser past so they can quit speaking the EUROPEAN SPANISH language and go back to speaking Aztec, that way you imbeciles will quit calling these NON-SPANIARDS, NON-WHITES ""Hispanics"" or ""Latino"" and call them what they are, Red indigenous native Americans. That way you will learn the DIFFERENCE. Pendejos gringos! It's about time! Blacks are no longer called Negroes, it's now an insult to call Asians Orientals (even though Taj Mahal Indians are also Asians, duh!!!) so quit calling Mexicans ""Hispanic"" or we will start calling you yanks English or British!

War Games I'm not happy about the way that you make war games for just adults. I think that you could make more war games that are for adults but you could also make a child's version of them. It would be great for children to not get jealous of their parents because they are playing the game and not them. I'm sure lots of children would like to buy the games if they were suitable for them.

A drummer can play anyway he/she wants to, there's no special way of playing that all drummers have to go by. So I want all this crap removed in the next 7 days. If not, I will erase it.

Yeah, we all know how much wikipedia is ruled by political correctness. It's a shame.
resignation After months of contributing to this site I have finally had enough of its petty, pathetic, idiotic rules and guidelines! Firstly on the article the fog you try adding just a few things and some complete wanker goes and starts undoing it all, just because it's not what they think is right. Then you get told about a load of rules and guidelines for pitty sake. Why are there rules and guidelines on a free editing site? But worst of all why do some of the stupid editors think they are in government!?!? They think they are all great and powerful but really they're weak and pathetic! After all that I had been defeated by a few idiots, so I left it if they want to be that stupid let them. I had been editing George of the jungle 2 for some time but all my work had been undone, I can only think the editor went through my contributions to see what I had been doing. I tried coming to a solution with them but again it was ignored. So because they were determined to have their way I had to let them. This is the sort of thing that goes on a lot and I have had enough. I won't try and contribute as it either goes against what someone thinks is right or goes against some poxy rule! Well what a shit site! Also saying my English is poor, well George of the jungle 2 starts a sentence with anyway for crying out loud!!! I'm done bye thanks for nothing .

Kosova was NEVER Serbia Look, if Kosova was in Serbia, Serbia would have never invaded it, and the west would not have driven them out would they. Noel Malcolm's article is precise that in 1912, Serbia occupied Kosova. It was not a liberattion because the 75% then-Albanian majority never welcomes them. It stayed occupied until it joined Yugoslavia in which it and Serbia were federal counties. This is sourced everywhere, so why do Serbo-nationaliosts continuously revert these edits???

But these are the facts and the whole world knows it. Just because you are Sunni doesn't mean you should try to suppress factual comments about your extremist religion. What do you think this war on terror is all about? Who do you think bombed WTC? Who bombed London on 7/7? All Sunnis. Who carried out all those bombing campaign in Bangladesh killing lots of innocent people? All Sunnis. Who is doing all those suicide bombings in Pakistan? All Sunnis. So what is your problem? Why are you so subversive to facts? I thought wiki was all about facts and not POV. May be you should try to do something to fix your religion rather than trying to suppress facts. The facts that everyone knows anyway and your effort is futile. Come out of this Ostrich mentality. You are not fooling anyone.

Christian Regenhard Whenever you get a chance, I would love to hear your voice on the proposed deletion of [{Christian Regenhard]]'s article. You helped so much in getting the original article in order and thought it would not be fair to not hear your voice. Here is a link to the article . Many thanks!
At the end of the day though, you deserve each other. If you don't see how the link I provided isn't a BLP violation in the slightest, and nearly 24 hours after I posted it you still wanted to call such evidence of basic incompetence as mere 'allegations', then I hope you both take each other down into the depths of merry hell in future, because S&P; must be very emboldened now at seeing what they can acheive with very little knowledge at all, by simply crying infront of people like you. And as far as that sort of pathetic wikipolitics goes, that's at least one thing they do seem to have a learning capacity for. Just look at how many new words and phrases they've learned in that regard, just from that one ANI, which will no doubt come in handy the next time they fuck up and delete something for being a BLP violation when it isn't, or asking for signs of notability for in-article content, or any of the other stupid things he does, and repeats because he just won't be told, because he's an incompetent. I'm sure the project will flourish if it self-selects editors who only have that skill, while kicking out the ones who do know their arses from their elbows, and can actually write content without making a fucking balls up of it at step 1.

Masem, in that case would you have any objections if I added the info in this article: http://www.theonion.com/articles/judases,16373/ to Chaplin's page? Could you at least take a closer look at the content of reliable news sources before you legitimize them? This is a joke, Jack Sebastian knows that it is a joke and I don't think that wikipedia policies are there for people to passive-aggressively dance around and find loopholes in like some 5 year old with crumbs on his mouth who says that you can't prove he stole the cookies from the cookie jar since you didn't actually see him do it. This is not simply a notable news story that had a few days of coverage and is therefore legitimate and meant for the ages. This was just a joke, on the same level as the Onion or the Daily Show and for whatever reason news sources that are not primarily satirical reported it, briefly. Is this really a question of the letter of wiki policy and the intent of wiki policy?

Bahai World Centre computers edited 77 articles== http://wikiscanner.virgil.gr/f.php?ip1=192.115.144.0-151.255 The Wikiscanner shows that the computers of the Bahaim WC have edited articles on wikipedia. This is only from computers at their WC in Haifa, Israel. Seeing that the Internet Committee of the respective National Spiritual Assemblies utilizes and hires people on all ends, the individuals here are obviously appointees of the National Spiritual Assemblies of Canada and the United. This clearly violates wikipedia policies and confirms what Kurt Nimmo has been stating overall and what I have been asserting that wikipedia is being actively used as a propaganda and misinformation platform for agents of the Haifan Bahai organization. ==

" Sources for Lincoln laughing when he was shot I have several sources that write about Lincoln laughing when he was shot; ""While waves of laughter echoed through the theater, James Ferguson kept his eyes focused on Abraham Lincoln...the president joined the crowd with a 'hearty laugh...""- The Darkest Dawn: Lincoln, Booth, and the Great American Tragedy by Thomas Goodrich ""...it is a comfort of sorts to know that the bullet hit Lincoln mid-guffaw. Considering how the war had weighed on him, at least his last conscious moment was a hoot.""- Assassination Vacation by Sarah Vowell"
WTF? Banned? Some person in a fourm said it is banned in Syria do to the closeness of the names Al-Asad and Al-Assad. The correct form is Al Asad in the game. I said he was wrong and he went crazy saying some dumb stuff that I was stupid. Who is right, cause I could find No Source that confirmed his statement that this game is banned in Syria. Asad and Assad are very common middle eastern names anyway 72.138.216.89
" Request for help with user-user dispute. A user, Ryulong, is insisting on reverting my edits, even on the Hawaiian language page where I am serving as Wikipedia's expert on the subject, and I am the major contributor. I made contributions to the WikiProject Hawaii Manual of Style, but Ryulong again reverted my contributions, falsely calling my contributions ""vandalism"". I believe that Ryulong should be blocked, and prevented from editing the Hawaii-related articles to which I contribute. I have near-native fluency in Hawaiian language, and a PhD in Linguistics. I've lived in Hawaii for about 50 years. This guy Ryulong does not know diddly squat about Hawaiian language. And he blatantly lies about things relating to editing on Wikipedia. I'm willing to go through whatever process is necessary in order for Wikipedia to stop this Ryulong from making trouble. Please don't agree to help me with this, unless you can effectively deal with the uncooperative user who lies about me and lies about Wikipedia. But if you really can help, then please do. Thanks. "

Um, the ethnic hatred was largely due to the Han Chinese or even minority Hui Muslims being more successful than Tibetans are. That's what they complained about. They did not complain about how some country invaded them almost years ago. That's why it was the poorest of the Tibetans rioting, not the middle class. The two Western reporters who interviewed residents both came to that conclusion. Maybe you should do more research on the topic before speaking? I know you're pro-tibet and probably Buddhist, you're really giving Pro-Tibet people a bad name with this biased garbage. 216.252.71.154

" Oops, my bad. Here's the explanation. When I do a restoration I always upload an unrestored version for documentation purposes. Normally I upload that to Commons, although with this particular image I accidentally uploaded the unrestored version locally. So as soon as I realized the mistake I uploaded over at Commons and put a deletion request on the local version. There's seldom any need for the unrestored version of a featured picture to have a hosting locally. The restored version got featured, though. So there's a reason to host it locally: the featured star is useful if anyone considers replacing it at an article (and occasionally editors do accidentally remove featured pictures from their primary articles). Hope that explains it, and best wishes. Charge! "

" Walking in on the middle of an argument Thanks for the message, however the analogy you've chosen is incorrect, when I walk in on an argument then I cannot have heard what has happened before, however on a talk page I can read the whole thing and trace any talk page discussion. When I posted my first question was intentionally dumbed down, as if I didn't know what was going on, then as the replies came in I could respond to them. In terms of NPOV in articles this is how I see it; for example, person A writes and article which contains the phrase ""Scientology is bad"", there is then an article written about Person A, Mr A was born in..., and on..., and live with..., et cetera. Then under his work it says ""He wrote an article saying 'Scientology is Bad'"". I could not in all conscience remove that statement from the article, because the bias is from the speaker not the editor. The gist of the talk page on WP:SCN was that any negative comments which had been quoted accurately but were negative should be ""balanced"" out. And that is not something I could let happen. "
I'm not clear whether a picture of a child's genitalia is legitimate or not - you appear to be more familiar with the way it works than me; perhaps you should ask whether images of children's genitalia are acceptable on Wikipedia. I object to it for several reasons. The is first that it is an image of a child's genitalia (albeit deceased), which is not usually accepted online for non-intersex children, and I am not sure why intersex childrens' genitals should be an exception to this. Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications. I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people. So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex? No, it is not. So, why is it there? Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails. I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary. People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia.
" word up? Dear Moderator Malik Shabazz, You are a total fucking loser. After writing my first response I got your little message about my ""original research"". When I saw your what your name was I almost laughed- not because it's Arab, which is fine, but because I could see the rest of the story coming. And sure enough- you have pictures of Malcolm X, former leader of the Nation of Islam, which is essentially the black KKK. What a fucking joke. Go cry about white; nothing in my last entry was untrue- the only thing that's even remotely questionable is my line about the majority of people in Ghettos dropping out of school and having teen pregnancy (but it is true). But why did you delete the segment about people getting scholarships to Harvard, or the fact that there are black politicians- are these bits original research? You and your black KKK buddies need to stop living in the fucking 1700s and wake up to the present- the whole world over is all about Meritocracy and Plutocracy, not race.

From the little I've read, it seems that there are mass ""disappearances"", body parts being found, the mass grave, and such. I've asked WikiProject Human Rights to take a look at the content here since the debate is a little beyond my pay grade as they say. I still don't quite see the problem with adding a sentence to the lead (once we figure out what prose is suitable for the body), since the purpose of the lead is to summarize content found elsewhere in the article.

I know for a fact that Bambu does many many millions a year in sales.. Upwards of 10mil after having drinks with a trade rep of theirs at a show in Vegas.. Are you just a hater on the brand? if you would like to talk maybe you should give me a call.. Winnie

" When I say ""insecurity"", I mean as a result of the PRC's continued emphasis on ""liberating Taiwan"" and coupling the issue with the national psyche to the point where no one in Beijing today could afford to be seen as having ""lost Taiwan"" (the fact that Taiwan has never been part of the PRC not withstanding). Remember that Taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the CCP and the KMT before World War II, with Mao even being quoted in the 30's as supporting Taiwan independence from Japan. Why Taiwan and not Mongolia? Well politics basically... the PRC's need to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union at the time and to drum up support against ""western imperialism"" and CKS's Taipei regime. CKS of course also recognized Mongolia in the 20's or 30's to try to woo Soviet support, but ""revoked it"" (ha ha) after 1949 as there was no need to try to placate the Soviets anymore. Today CKS and Mao are long gone but the shadow of their vendettas still remain. - "

Deletion Jeff, I hope you understand that I cannot and will not delete your contributions from the site.

There is no provision for if you simply want everything you've done gone from the site. [talk]
I just left a note about procuring source materials, on your talk page. Also, with reference to your mention of Cassini's tables, you might like to notice that the practice about 'signs' in the eighteenth-century tables was to treat a 'sign' as just a superior unit of 30 degrees: this is shown by the presence of this unit also in the tables of increments corresponding to periods of time, and in the tables of angular differences (such as mean anomaly), these usages show that such a 'sign' did not need to begin at any particular place, it was just any arc of 30 degrees, a practice also mentioned as occasionally occurring in ancient times, I think, by O Neugebauer in 'History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy'.

Later on in [] he says that the measured particle becomes entangled with the apparatus, as the whole system evolves according to the many body version of his equation, and that the only [fundamental] discontinuity is a mental one as the experimenter takes note of the result of the experiment. He explains quantum entanglement quite clearly and thoroughly, but seem not to have an answer to the EPR paradox. There is some real philosophy of science there, addressing issues that I have not seen covered in Wikipedia.

" THE USED WORDS OPENLY MAKE THIS ARTICLE A VERY BIASED ONE I would like the person who wrote the line that ""an increasing number(!) of Turkish intellectuals"" support the genocide THAT HE SHOW SOME REFERENCE and PROOF. Also the SO-CALLED fact that over a million Armenians are killed IS A VERY DUBIOUS ONE AND REQUIRES SOME PROOF. WHAT MAKES WIKIPEDIA, WIKIPEDIA IS THE FACT THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A TRAGEDY AS IMMENSE AS 9/11, IT PRESERVES ITS NEUTRALITY. HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS ARTICLE NEUTRAL IF IT SMELLS HEAVILY BIASED? For example the VERY IMPORTANT START PARAPGRAPH SHOULD BE MODIFIED LIKE , SAY "" It is also alleged that over a million Armenians were killed during the relocation etc...."" OTHERWISE; you have to show immediate references or supporting articles, proofs etc. I would like to receive those proofs, if this is really a documented proof, I very much would like to read them. PLEASE REFER TO SOME RESPECTED ENCYCLOPEDIA LIKE BRITTANICA ABOUT THE SO-CALLED ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, TO SEE WHAT NEUTRALITY REALLY MEANS ! No academic research , conducted in Turkish Republic, ever denies the fact that ""MANY"" Armenians were killed during the relocation but ""A MILLION"" IS REALLY A BAD EXAGGERATE. Just because there are some PUNKS ( Do they call themselves System of Something? ) who make their homeland's propaganda, does not mean that you can falsify the history.

I believe that a published works of the very genre of discussion is an important addition to the article. The date of the published works is also relevant. The publisher itself is also relevant to list (as is listed in the citation). This article is on music. The creators of that music should be discussed in my opinion, and I don't think there are any editors who would disagree with this. The reason why the creators should be cited, is because they are part of the history. The link to discogs is for viewing purposes and I think is a good way for readers to visually look at the published work. I suspect you are having some emotional response, and I didn't mean to cause this. Trust me. Once again within 10 seconds of me editing the Wiki you reverted. My mind is boggled how you can do it that quickly, that's for sure.

" Oh dear, this is very much what I didn't want to do here but, no, per WP:Engvar it should be nothing of the kind unless you can show me where WP:Engvar says ""always use 'an' in BrE in these cases"". It's a form of synthesis to say 1. ENgvar says use BrE here so 2. this should say ""an historic"", because it requires me to accept the unspoken step 1a. the correct BrE usage is ""an historic"". This I do not accept: I know it is used by some BrE speakers but others, including me, find it archaic and frankly embarrassing. So I see no justification for changing it, and I feel it is important to assert that people who want to say ""an historic"" cannot simply hide it behind EngVar and BrE. But this is what I mean about trying to avoid the I know I am right about this bit because of course we both know that we are and we can both - well, if we could be bothered - go on asserting that I am right and you are wrong ad infinitum.

" Again, I don't think this is productive, but I'll make my position clear anyway. Oppose. There are some sources here that support the idea that various types of nuclear power have been considered as sustainable, but that wasn't the only reason the IPs edits were reverted. This is one reason tying this into the above discussion is a bad idea, because this isn't just about the academic consensus on a loosely defined ""type of nuclear fission"". Using the article to explain in context that nuclear power is in some ways sustainable, according to some points of view, would be fine. The edits introduced large quantities relatively weakly sourced material to present nuclear as being a primary and uncontroversial source of sustainable energy. The above sources support mentioning nuclear as one aspect of sustainability. They do not warrant altering the article to make nuclear energy the first specific section, nor do they warrant excessive ref-bombing to support that perspective, while using similarly selective tactics to undermine those who hold a more critical perspective. This isn't just about verifiability, this is also about WP:WEIGHT. Even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear's sustainability is under-researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment. This is true for many areas of sustainable energy research, but especially nuclear. It is an active area of research (or areas, rather) which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters. This should not be used to diminish that perspective or the potentially revolutionary research, but major context was being selectively left-out from the proposed edits. "

" POV statement which couldn't be salvaged I removed the following statement from the article, hoping that someone will rewrite this. ""Former CIA agent John Stockwell, who was stationed in Angola while working with the CIA, argued that the CIA murdered 10,000 Angolans by arbitrarily warmongering.http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4068.htmhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c35COXObeo8"" Reasons I think it's POV: ""arbitrarily"" - Please elaborate, and explain how this is relevant to the article ""warmongering"" - I think this term is rarely appropriate in an encyclopedia, and certainly not here. There are many other better words. The 10,000 figure isn't even mentioned in the article itself. So, if it's not important or noteworthy enough to put there, why does it belong in a broad article about the country? The 10,000 figure appears to come from his recollection. Since when do we rely one person, an activist at that, to be the sole source for a casualty estimate? The U.S.'s involvement is more of a side note here, and does not really fit in with the rest of the description of Angola's history. In another article about, I don't know, CIA activities in Angola, maybe, but not here. "

" And finally, I believe you're making a guileful, if rather inept use of the concept of ""original research"". I challenge you to find me reliable sources stating that 3*16=48. If possible, making such fact the center of the article or a relevant part thereof. Same here, with the additional fact that it is the producers and distributors who decide a relevant part of the critics' response to a filmand this is not conspiracy theory, this is basic market dynamics. The plot for Oculus contains the same relevant points as the one for The Boogeyman: * two siblings witness the death of their parents/mother's boyfriend at the hands of one of them, and the whole scene is preternaturally captured by a mirror * this happens after one of the siblings had been chained/tied up in their bedroom by the victims, then freed by the other sibling * years later the murderous sibling (in both cases the brother) is still psychologically scarred by the event * and murders and unnatural phenomena arising from the ghost-catching mirror and its shards ensue. Do I need sources to see a pattern? This is like calling the film a ""horror film"" without a source. Would you refrain from calling it so even if no source did? Would it be ""original research""? Come on. "

What about the following calculation: ? I am aware that I use a bit more than the axioms in your list, but it seems from your motivation that you accept implicitly rules like associativity and inverses of each element. I would be interested in knowing exactly at which step of my calculation I violate your intuition. Best,

Scholars have noted many different causes, but one I reacall from undergrad that i found most interesting was that era politicains uneccessarily exploited societal cleavages for their own political gain, and in doing so divided the nation far beyond anything that could be mended without war.

" Um, yeah, sorry about the wall o' text... I get a bit carried away with this stuff. The problem with the whole ""505%"" thing is that 5x the insolation at the top of the atmosphere does not necessarily equate to 5x the insolation at the surface. The effect the atmosphere has as far as where that energy ends up scattered back into space, absorbed and reradiated in the upper atmosphere, trapped near the surface via a runaway greenhouse effect, etc. is huuuuuuuge. We don't know anything about the atmosphere, so it's not really as cut and dried as you might initially think. I agree with you that some of the media coverage has been a bit more cheerleader-ish than is warranted, and don't particularly want to see that stuff in the article either. What would be useful to incorporate is a presentation of the literature's discussion of what would be required for Gl 581 c to actually be habitable.

Verifiability I urge all editors to read Wikipedia:Verifiability. This is official wikipedia policy. I would like to point out this section in particuluar: Articles should contain only material that has been published by reputable or credible sources, regardless of whether individual editors regard that material to be true or false. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. For that reason, it is vital that editors rely on good sources.

Please, this is not censorship. In fact, the usage of other languages is mentioned in the main article. If it were censorship, all matter pretaining to the other languages usage in Malaysia would be removed. In fact, in the first paragragh, there are SEVEN ways how to call Malaysia in various languages and scripts. The official language box can only have Malay because Malay is the only official language. Unlike India, South Africa, or Canada or Singapore of which their constitutions say there are more than one official language, Malaysian constitution explicitly says only Malay is the official language. Thus - only Malay in the official language box. Wikipedia's job is to spread information, not make new information. See WP:NOR. For usual convention, see Template_talk:Infobox_Country. For general rule of thumb on naming, see Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English). In fact, if we were to follow WP's guideline tightly, the first paragragh SHOULDN'T list the other SIX languages/scripts. An implicit compromise was made earlier on this if you cared to check the page history. If you push this, it's likely that, according to WP:UE, all other languages will be removed, undoing the implicit compromise. And for precedence from other article, see Portal:Montreal/Discussions/English Names/Draft policy. Also, Wikipedia_talk:Language_policy. See also United States of America - no Spanish despite Spanish is the second most spoken language in the US. How about Indonesia? As for your precedence, could you point to any where the constitution says there's only one official language while there are many other major spoken languages that are included in the box?

of ancient halikarnassos suggest that the city was extensively planned by Mausolus during his reign as Dynast/Satrap. He moved his dynastic seat from Mylasa to Halikarnassos and unified the whole pennisula in the Greek model. This reconstitution included the mausoleum in the centre of the city, adjacent to the agora - the most prominent place in the polis. As such it is likely that Mausolus planned the monument as a heroon, a shrine to himself as founder of Halikarnassos reconstituted; so when Pliny talks about the artists and sculptures employed to work

Removed text I removed the following text from the article: ==Seating plans== The predominant floor plans are comprised of vis-a-vis resp. face to face seats, seating rows resp. face to back with split orientation (half in each direction) for trains operated in both directions and a combination of those principles. In regional transport we can find seats aligned with the tracks to give more room to the standing passengers. In scenic trains seats are beeing orientied some degrees to the window are used. Some design variants have curved banks of seats to form a lounge. Flip flop seats that can be changed from face to face to face to back orientation are not used much due to its weights and consequences of the additional mechanism. While this information could still be valuable, I don't think it's worded very well here. Besides, the seating arrangements are different for each car type, and this text deals more with coaches than other types. It seems to me that seating arrangements are better described on the car type pages themselves and not here. 20:48, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)
" So you're dismissing people who think it could undermine the ""anyone can edit"" philosophy, but not the ones who are making impossible proposals for trials? Besides, it's a moot point; Brion asked for two-thirds of the community before he switched it on. At the current rate, you need fifty more people to agree. Jimbo, you're bound by devolution of the decision to the community and Brion's two-thirds requirement, and (ethically) by Wikipedia's standards for closing discussions. While the community is in weak support of FR (60% is weak support for most community decisions), it hasn't fit the marker Brion asked for, nor are you an impartial judge in this (having supported the proposal beforehand). Please devolve the consensus interpretation to either the ArbCom or the bureaucrats, and don't ask Brion to switch it on until his requirement has been fulfilled. '''''' "

So you're trying to justify the block because of that response?

" Final Fantasy (video game) I was wondering about two things regarding the article: As the article is essentially about the original game, it's pretty much assumed that the gameplay and plot sections refers to the NES version's gameplay. Therefore I believe ""(NES version)"" in the caption of the first two images in the body are unnecessary, while the image of the WSC version needs to state that it's from the WSC version. There are several parentheses throughout the plot section that confuse me. Example: ""Lefeinish (Lufenian)"". I think it refers to the original name, and to the name used in later versions in parenthesis, but I'm not sure. Anyway, if I'm correct, I think the parentheses can be removed, based on my first comment. A hidden note could also be added, telling the reader that the name's refer to the original game. So, what do you think? "

Thanks for the suggestion... Re: Friends episodes articles. I used the capitals used in the main List of Friends episodes page where prior editor(s) capitalized all the first letters of the titles. I totally agree with your point though. I will take some time to format these correctly as well. As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth. What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format. As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job. (I'm even using the little nav table) I am going to try very hard not to just regurgitate what's already available out there.

"==Material deleted, incorrect material put in place by user Pgagnon999== A certain user has deleted correct information and posted politically biased information in this article. These are all in the first three paragraphs on the history of the town. Paragraph 1. The original town name of Middletown was spelled ""Mattabeseck"", this can be seen in the records of the general Assembly of Connecticut, which were QUOTED in this article until the ignorant and unscrupulous poster deleted the reference. This is significant in that southwestern Algonquin was spoken with a much harder inflection on the consonants, -and Mattabeseck is a southwestern Algonquin town. Paragraph 2. Quotations about Puritan life in general are irrelevant in this article. Paragraph 3. William Cronin is not a reliable source for local detail in Connecticut. Cronin's highly inflammatory accounts of the history of the settlement of America is very controversial, and has been shown to be very factually inaccurate and unreliable. It was very popular as a piece of political argument, and very poor historical scholarship. That this article MUST include this kind of erroneous detail is unfortunate. That the systems and procedures that define Wikipedia are not able to withstand this kind of assault from the politically-minded and ignorant marks the limitation of Wikipedia's usefulness. "

The arrest of Gerry Adams isn't front page news according to Wikipedia If you want to know why, read the Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates page. There you will find all sorts of uninformed, illogical, and downright dishonest claims about the UK legal system and the way the British press works. You will also see the quite idiotic claim that, by ignoring this news, Wikipedia is somehow defending Adam's from defamation - something apparently the rest of the world's media (and indeed Wikipedia's own article on Adams), isn't apparently all that concerned about. If like me, you think this is contemptible, and want to challenge it - then you will just have complain to your congressman I guess, because it has become clear to me today at Wikipedia talk:In the news that the people at Wikipedia who make those sort of arguments, will absolutely, positively, not answer any questions at all about it - and others will apparently defend their rights to do so, by closing down such discussions. Apparently it's 'disruptive' to question the logic that goes into faulty Wikipedia decision making like this. As always, if you want to know what's going on the world, consult the other 'old media' outlets who, for all their faults, still make it their job to report on the news in a serious and credible manner. Only come to Wikipedia if you want to know about video games and other stuff nobody really gives a crap about.

It is well known that in the dorms at night almost every boy is wanking. Its the unofficial school sport! Smoking grass and wanking ) Forget about these are the sons of the great and the mighty they are all little wankers. Now stop being silly and remove the ban. One other thing. By banning my ip address you are banning 650 students who also use the same address. Is this the high water mark of your bright ideas? One other thing. What is the point of having editors when silly twats like you operate as thought police or cencors? My guess is wiki will go the same way all the other great sites have gone afre they get too clever for their own good. The chap who thought this thinfg up in the fiorst place should have taken the money and run when he had that option.
Hi Paranoid. I aggree that the Moscow page needs work. We also need to work on articles within moscow - for example, the MSU page is shocking bad. But I'd argue that most people who add to the moscow page have an honest interest and fondness for the place, or they wouldn't bother editing it. Maybe what we need is a 'List of Moscow related articles needing work' or some such. The Recreation section is bad and It been an eyesore since feb. What should we add to it? There's a F1 circuit being built in the south, anybody want to add that? also some stuff on the football clubs would be good (we can leave out the supporter violence, which is a usual thing all over the world). To be honest, I don't know much about this area - not a football fan. I'd also argue against only adding material which is positive. We shouldn't have an audience only of americans in mind.

Notable alumni == This section badly needs cleaning up. I am happy so to do but I should like to seek support, here, first. A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately. To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please. I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met. I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on. ==

Wikipedia is not for writing about yourself Hi. Welcome to Wikipedia, but it is not a social-networking site like Myspace or Facebook for people to write about themselves or make contacts. It is a quite different sort of site, a project to build an encyclopedia, so it is selective about subjects for articles, and writing about oneself is strongly discouraged, for reasons explained at Wikipedia is not about YOU and Wikipedia:Autobiography. The links in the Welcome message at the top of this page will tell you more about Wikipedia. Regards,

Inconsistent Notation It looks like this page uses in some places and in others.
" I think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea, at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very well-known example of free culture. That wikipedia is a part of free culture should be pretty self-apparent from the way it's defined in the article (""social movement[s] that [promote] the freedom to distribute and modify creative works, using the Internet as well as other media""), and from the license used. The self-referencing seems ok, as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where it's relevant. If wikipedia is an example of online free culture, then it's relevant. As for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission, I don't see that as any stranger than FLOSS not gobbling up proprietary software. Free culture things are things that let you copy, distribute and modify them. Proprietary things generally don't, and so using them without permission isn't allowed, and therefore you can't include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free (or even legal). If you want to use copyrighted pictures and such on wikipedia, it seems to me that is to ask the owner to change the license, or at least follow fair usage guidelines. "
" I meant to type efficacy, hence the strikethrough.

Also what about the word chink on your userpage? Whereas negro may be considered offensive by some, although I've never heard of it being used in offensive context. And negro is used often in non-offensive contexts like in Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speeches, the names of various black organizations , etc... I believe chink is pretty much always considered offensive. Why do you have it on your userpage? You are obviously a troll.
"::No we aren't. The article talks about ""inserting 22 days before the last five days of February"" the impliaction being that 22 new days were insterted and the days that followed formed a part of the monthy of February. That is an idea I have seen in a number of places on USENET and would imply that (a) intercalarius has only 22/23 days and (b) that the last days of the year (before March) would be part of February again contemporary evidence says no. It may be this is not what the article means, but in that case it should say that February was shortened and followed by Interc. of 27 days (is that what you think it says?). There's no discussion of the additional day by the way. "

That's more like material for a law review article. There's an upcoming session at Wikimania on this issue . That might produce more reliable sources. There's some minor debate in the legal community as to whether Meshwerks went too far, but no later cases. Wikipedia has been relying on Bridgeman vs. Corel for over a decade; there's been one legal threat, and no lawsuits. This seems to be a settled issue.

- I also would like to know your reason for listing Aleksander Kamensky article for deletion last time? - Also I don't understand why you changed Russian intelligent to Soviet intelligent. The subject considered himself a Russian art critic. He never identified himself with the Soviet regime especially since you claim in intelligentsia article that the Soviets had an unflattering attitude towards intelligentsia (which is a very very half truth by the way). - You still haven't explained why you did not mention the history of intelligentsia during the Soviet epoch. The term was popularized in Soviet Russia, and the article is not balanced with main emphasis on Poland, a provincial obscure place like Belarus.

"::::::::Of course it's incoherent, but that's probably more a problem of your remedial reading comprehension abilities than it is a problem of my writing abilities. Anybody with half a brain would be able to figure out what I'm trying to say: my response to rd232 is that he himself undermines the legitimacy of his actions of deleting my additions of criticisms of CounterPunch on its Wikipedia page when he points out, ""it's feasible to cover the relevant controversies in a neutral and balanced manner (written as part of the History section, and avoiding unnecessary direct quotation of political opponents' smear phrases"" which means that not only are changes (not deletion) of the criticisms doable, but also that the quotes of criticism about CounterPunch need to exist in the first place if you want to make the quotes as balanced as possible. (which again, can't be done if Rd232 is deleting any criticism of CounterPunch in the first place) But again, like I said, chances are you probably won't understand what I'm saying because my writing abilities are above and beyond your level of reading comprehension, so it's unlikely you're response will comprise of anything more than ad hominems, rather than addressing the content of my comment.

You're both right, we can't quantify - but ""many"" isn't a quantity - it's an appropriately vague term. I think it's fair to draw from the sources that ""many in Ireland object to the term"", considering the content of footnote 2.

"Activision is the publisher, not the developer. The developer is Cauldron. Offical Site? What confirmation is there that the offical site is offical and not just a fan site with the logo on it? I checked the page mercenarieswanted.com and it seems it was registered to an advertising company called ""Gabriel deGrood Bendt"" while a search of doom3.com or callofduty.com shows are registered to Activision(obviously). you can check by yourself by going to a domain information website like: checkdomain.com Note that if you visit their website http://www.always-thinking.com/ and click on the 'our work' tab you'll find that Activision is a client. The advertising company is located in the same City / State as ActivisionValue (Although that may be purely coincidence).

hi mate he is not NisarKand because Beh-Nam is a Tajik and NisarKand an Awghan, an ethnic Pashtune. Dear Admins, plz check that out also his IPs. They are two different User. While NisarKand and DilbarJan are one and the same User and a nationalistic one but Beh-Nam has nothing to do with such activities. DilbarJan(/NisarKand) claimed he would helping Taliban but since Beh-Nam is a Persian and the Taliban were looking for cleansing Tajiks who could he be NisarKand self since Dilbar is allready NisarKand!? Plz dear Admins, unblock him. Beh-Nam is for a long time on Wikipedia and he didnt do sth bad either against any nations nor against any User or any articles. The admins of Wikipedia now banned two or three of Tajiks who were one o the important ones here at least they were the sole Tajiks who were active. Plz Admins, ban DilbarJan who is writing articles from his nationalistic view. With best regards

" Well, you're using criteria that you have decided constitute a legitimate decision procedure for establishing whether something is Israeli. Content decisions can't be made that way here.

It is a shame what people are here, I am disgusting of you.
It sounds like AussieLegend also thinks we should use proper English in the credits. I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television. This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done. I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof). This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately. Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar). The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert. Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others. I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table. Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before). Again, though, there is no statement anywhere in policy that I can find that specifies which format should be used.
Truce? Fair enough, i understand; one point that i must make clear though is that i will not resist from adding/editing information to things which i find interesting etc (i.e. Louise etc). Personally, it is not me who links everything but that is of little matter. Also i do cite and use very 'reputable sources' for all information that i have contributed be it books or another source. I will however, in keeping with the WP:3RR and personal choice, not edit anymore today but will resume later tomorrow; i will add such things and i would rather that you say to me what is unnecessary. Such things as lists of siblings (as has been seen i have a rather bad habit) etc will be kept to a minimum. Your views will be seriously noted. As i said Sure our paths will meet again - Happy editing - this time not in such a vicious tone. )
It's extremely comical listening to someone who runs around with a convicted felon, violent psycho terrorist punk and child abuser like Mordecai Levy pass judgement on anyone elses associations.

" Thanks again for your timely intervention at the right time and in the right manner in this regard and putting my attention to this very grave matter. My faith is reinforced in that accuracy almost always wins (as it should) against ""popular"" and short-sighted ideological approach of some. I am very satisfied with the outcome and reverting to the very accurate title Syrian uprising (2011present) rather than ""civil war"" that did have majority voting in discussions but was erroneously based on subjective look into things rather than the international media that continuously refers to it as an uprising. My firm conviction that even majority votes on talk pages should not be binding. I nominate that this discussion becomes a precedence to other talk pages where we don't automatically follow majorities but we rely basically on reliable and objective outside sources. Talk page votes may be taken into some consideration, but should never be the basis of final decision. Again thanks for you for your efforts and not descending into a war particularly with colleagues I7laseral and Doncsecz. "

If you would like to experiment, please use Wikipedia:Sandbox for test edits. Thank you. Ali What the fuck is your problem. Did you even read what I deleted? DO you know what the word PLOT means? Plot does NOT mean talking about the movie's trailer or what genre the movie it is. A plot is a SUMMARY of the movie. Read what's in the Plot section of ""solaris"" right now you fucking retard and tell me if it really belongs under the section plot... or any other section. It looks more like trivial facts which are unsupported and should be DELETED as per wiki regulations. Here's an example, dumb fuck, from the solaris wiki page: ""The film essentially ignores the planet which only serves as an anonymous backdrop, in contrast to Lem's novel which discusses at length the mysterious phenomena on its surface and the futile human attempts to understand them."" That is NOT neutrality and has NOTHING to do with the plot. Jesus FUCKInG CHRIST. Wiki is full of fucking morons. Delete that shit. "

Indefinite block on 68.126.252.131 Hey!

Probably best??? Clearly not. Your objectivity is exposed as bankrupt with comments like that. And your cause is in shambles. I've played Devil's Advocate and been a provocateur in the past, on the other side, but when you stoop to my level, you lose. You must be like Caesar's wife, not a intellectual prostitute, don't you know? Your cause is now lost, as evidenced by Copenhagen. Maybe in the next generation things might change, especially if Peak Oil turns out to be true. But for now AGW is finished with the average person in the USA and China (carbon neutral UK is another matter, and irrelevant). Back and fill, damage control from here on out. Goodbye.

You undid my additions to the Mountain Gorilla which clearly contributed to the page, Wikipedia, and the human species in its entirety. You are an anarchist and a communist. Sincerely hope you stub your big toe on your left foot tomorrow when you get out of bed. I would hope meaner things, but my just and kind heart is capable of no greater levels of hate than I have just described. Due to your rude behavior (which was completely uncalled for by the way) I will no longer contribute my vast intellectual knowledge to Wikipedia, depriving the world of knowledge that it deserves to have, and it is all thanks to you. I am obviously a far better man that you, and will waste no more of my time dealing with your pitiful existence.
Comment: Can we successfully close and move the article now? There is a clear consensus in supporting a move, opposition is limited, with the major point of opposition being that a non-consensus that this article should be deleted because Other Stuff Is Non-Notable. Obviously that is not what is being discussed here, and so their opposition is void. It's also been 15 days since the issue opened, and three days since any new comments.
By the way look at the talk page and you'll see the moderators said not too revert the article back to the old version. so stop playing games and get a life. I know in colorado there is not much too do. But please try too find something else to do with your time.

" Minnesota Entertainment section The section, and the article in general, is starting to attract those who wish to mention their favorite groups or music festivals.

I would lose the recent additions and maybe a few others, especially given the subsidiary article on Music of Minnesota. But as you seem to be more ""in tune"" (sorry about that) with the music scene, maybe you could look at the new additions and decide what should stay and what should go. Thanks. "

"== Liquid Fire == Daria Huerta invented Liquid Fire. The term ""liquid fire"" was created in 1960 and the product was invented in 1940. Liquid fire helps burn off blemishes such as warts, boils, and blisters. It is used in many dermatologists around the world. It was also used in construction work to help get rid of walls. They would rub the liquid fire on the wall and let it burn the wall down. Daria Huerta was one of the world's most smartest women of her time. She also created common things such as the coffee cup, pillow, and the sink. The product went into stores in 1961. It was sold at stores like Walmart, CVS, Wallgreens, and Pharmacies all over the world. It was originally called ""Fire in the Water"" then they started calling it what it truly is ""Liquid Water"". Liquid water sold for $10.00 per box. Each box contains 7 15x10 jars full of Liquid Fire. Daria Huerta created the Cark. She was playing around with genes from a shark and a cat one day. A year later she created a mutated creature. It was half shark, half cat. She then released it into the wild in 1990. The Cark started destroying the whole ecosystem. They had to destroy the Cark which took about 5 years. In 1995 she then decided it was time for her to quit science so she became a seamstress. She was playing around with yarn and discovered a thin piece that had ripped off which she then used to clean her teeth. This was called floss. In 2000 she created flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and wintermint. Huerta died in 2001. The Picture Below is the ONLY Picture of the original Cark: /Users/Maddy/Pictures/sharkcat.jpg"

Delaware Gazette article Hello, I am working on an article about OWU's online resources,. Specifically, I am interested in doing some research on the OWU Wikiproject. Please contact me if you're interested in helping me with this article. Thank you.
Dude, you're not consistant. Anyone following your edits can see you only remove them on some articles (white-related) and not others where those same statements are made. Very silly, but don't reply. I have no need to talk to you or hear any excuses. Lame!
Thanks. I can see it is on process. Can you do me another help ? I have fixed the concerns raised by obi2canibe in the article. I promised him to insert rest of the things when I got the lists from him in the talk-page. Can you please ask obi2canibe to withdraw tags since now I can do little work until I get information he have ?

" For kicks, the primary author of ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"" is female, (I am also female. Many of the participants at FA are female and I do not believe women are underrepresented there.) and usually concentrates on 17th and 18th century women's and children's literature in the majority of her FA topics. I wrote the articles for To Kill a Mockingbird and Harvey Milk, among others (including FAs related to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which is a topic worthy of the dozens of books written about it). None of my articles got as many hits as Museum of Bad Art on April Fool's Day 2009. It's difficult to fault Wikipedians or FA writers for providing gimmicks when that's exactly what people respond to. Barnum noted that somewhere, more laconically I bet. I recall I stated that opinion in one format when Gropecunt Lane was on the main page. "

"::::::The term is 'reconquered'. These were not ""new lands"" but retaken occupied land by the Ottoman Turks. These lands were administered completely independent but they were NOMINALLY PART OF CROATIA AND SLAVONIA (Kingdom of Croatia). And stop already with the ""greater Croatia"" and ""greater Hungary"" crap as you have no ground for such argumentation against me whatsoever. The whole point here is not: whether Croatia was official language or not (Serbian wasn't either) and administration of Military Frontier but how is he referred in Croatian language and we both now it is 'Josip'. Not this is not ""incorrect"" nor ""Croatisation"" but merely different version of his name and he as an author of Croatian anthem and a man who was born in Vinkovci (present day Croatia) should have this version of the name up there as well.

It's not really for us to decide what is a conspiracy theory, but indeed, the article rather confusingly mixes conspiracy claims and factual information about Jewish leaders in the Bolshevik movement. There was a recent newspiece, a quote by Putin: Times of Israel - Putin: First Soviet government was mostly Jewish. Apparently some people feel such quote is conspiracist whereas others say it's just a statement of a statistical fact. In any case, the option is #1, the article shouldn't imply any notion of Jewish participation in the early communist movement is a conspiracy theory. However, I'm not sure if that general topic (Jews in the bolshevik movement) should be covered in detail in this article.'

What do you mean no accessible refs? Were they all dead? . The issue with per country sections is that we already have List of gun laws and policies by country in adition to the Gun politics in the United Kingdom article. the Nazi section above may superficially appear to be in that same grouping, but it is here as part of an argument about gun control in general. (I agree it should be moved from the history to the arguments section - as long as it is clear that the historical factsare uncontested). Information about the UK may also be relevant under a similar rationale, discussing the effectiveness or not of gun control (similar to the AU content)

" Here's something for you to report you have more poop in your pants. Vandals are people who disrupt wikipedia, like people who get bent out of shape over comments made on talk pages for IP address, rather than focusing on something... Important. They write condescending comments and put images of exclamation points in them and avoid communicating with other people like they're people, instead they use an impersonal language of template-style warnings sent like notices from bill collectors (who would, hypothetically also have poopie pants). You may feel like you're being very noble by reporting this kind of comments to AIV, and that when someone communicates with you in a way that you're not familiarly with or that makes you uncomfortable that it's ""vandalism"" and ""personal attacks."" But it's really not, it's just an emerging bureaucratic culture preventing wikipedia from becoming a true form of social networking and collaboration. Anyway, go ahead, go nuts, pick on people different from you and have me banned.

I am PISSED OFF Okay, I used to be a troll and a vandal. I used to be large amounts of my time insulting and upsetting users and ruining articles for my own amusement. Recently, I decided to turn a new leaf and become a decent, respectful contributor. I created an article called Adult Diapers in France. In this article, I included references and I hoped to create a series based on adult diaper production by country. Within minutes , User:Escape Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article, without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was 'advertising' and my page was 'unambiguously promotional'. This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article. Secondly, User:Purplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker. In conclusion, I am getting fed up of wikipedia. I am getting fed up of how admins just pounce on you if you are a newbie. I am seriously thinking of trolling and vandalising again. Good day

" Historians are incapable of second guessing Hitler's inner thoughts There may be some who believe that historians are capable of deciphering Hitler's inner thoughts, i.e. Hitler's religion. This is ignorance and stupidity. They write things such as ""while historians such as Ian Kershaw, Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock agree that Hitler was anti-Christian"". They do not even provide quotes of Ian Kershaw, Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock saying that Hitler was anti-Christian. All they are saying is trust us in our opinion the opinion of Ian Kershaw, Joachim Fest and Alan Bullock is that Hitler was anti Christian. A far better procedure is to rely on the opinion of Hitler himself as to his religion. "

":::Gay theology is heresy, period. Comparing Christian traditionalism on sexual issues with people who blow themselves up or who believe in using the sword is shear ignorance. I'm a traditionalist Catholic, and I regard Liberal ""Christians"" as really being nothing but secularists in Christian drag. I see no fault in anything that I have done except for dissenting from the Left-wing groupthink of Wikipedia. So, is it that only Lefties are allowed to edit on Wikipedia? Perhaps, are you scared of people who don't share your POV? All I have to say is just grow up. I have studied theology for years, and all that I can say is Liberals haven't a clue of what Christ meant about everything because they twist the scriptures to agree with their own egos. There is no such thing as a Liberal Christian, only a Liberal. "

So you find that a right-wing and left wing unreliable source agree and assume they must both be correct. There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources. The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians. Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time. We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons. We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848. Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government. We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false. The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable. Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian. Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream. We just do not know what Marx did with the 6,000 francs he received.

In what way is the source dubious? It is a book on the history of a church that has a very historic cemetery dating back to the 1700's. The coats of arms carved on the tombstones are no more dubious than any other coat of arms - they are a historical fact having existed for over 200 years.

Now a series of utter morons have taken it upon themselves to revert my work for no reason whatsoever.

All you had to do was go to Google and Google "" 'Robert Conrad' 'Spilotro' "" and it is the very first entry - in an interview he gave. It's quite well known. You didn't even bother to do even a minimum of research. I notice this a lot in Wikipedia - people deleting things they know nothing about, on subjects they know nothing about, and not bothering to do any research. For the record, I don't delete or even modify anything if I do not know the subject matter quite well. I don't know why you edited this out - you obviously know very little about Robert Conrad. Anyway, I've put it back in, with the very first link I found, which was the very first entry that comes up on Google when you put in both their names. Duh."
The FAC was in 2011. It's 2015 now and the RfC whether you like how it was set up or not is showing a number of established users with no previous input saying that the article could do with being edited. Pretending it's not happening won't change that. You have indeed been respectful in your suggestions, but others most certainly have not. And why waste time editing an article that's likely to become a redirect if the outcome of the RfC is to edit this article?

The Entire Canonical New Testament paragraph is wrong == There are no specific references to Lesbians.

Sun (with Solaris) always distributed the original software, the same applies to Slackware. Recently, most Linux distributions started to distribute the original cdrtools again. Debian did agree on Marh 6th 2009 (at CeBIT) to distribute the original cdrtools again (although Debian is soooooo slooooow with doing the right things and we are still waiting for the contract to be implemented by Debian - the binary packages are waiting for integration since 5 months) and Suse distributes cdrtools again since two months. It seems that only RedHat defies to do things to the benefit of the users. The attack against the cdrtools project that created the fork seems to have been revealed as an attack against the Linux users as it is obvious that Linux users do not like to be forced to use a buggy fork while the maintained original software is legally available.

You alone do not decide what is frivilous and what is not; those users who were also subject to Roux's intolerable attitude did not see the RfC/U as frivilous. Roux has insulted, blittled, slandered and dogged me for months now; knowing that because we edit the same pages because we have the same interests (with me being around long before him) we could not avoid each other indefinitely, I have done my utmost to resolve the matter in the most professional manner I could muster. But that process could not take place with Roux immune to any criticism; if you can find any evidence of anything beyond critique of his edits and editing habits - that is, actual attack, name calling, insulting - and one shred of proof that I ever stalked him, I urge that it be presented. To do otherwise is a incomprehensible abuse of position.

" In the 60s, there were no fraternities at ISU, and Normal was a dry town. By the time of the infamous beer riots, Normal was no longer dry, and there were frats all over the place. I can imagine Jesse Fell doing the ""told-you-so dance"". I don't mean to imply there was nothing at all going on at ISU in the late 60s. There were indeed demonstrations and no small amount of tension on campus. Just not like at SIU, where they had to close the campus and send everyone home, following the 1970 riots. What's up, Doc? carrots "

"::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was ""betrayed"" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy. 19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC) "

" Not sure how to answer clearly, but here goes... The concept of there being a need for a minimum difference in boiling points is erroneous and probably comes from rules of thumb for separating two pure phases in a single distillation using a simple apparatus. That is, if you can boil off 100% of phase A without boiling off/condensing phase B. Think back to WWII in Norway, when heavy water was separated from ""normal"" water by multiple distillation. The boiling point difference is only 1.4 degrees, yet heavy water was successfully produced."

Pres. George Bush says that reducing government spending is one of his highest priorities. But most of his policies and actions have not been concerned with lowering spending. So it would be inappropriate to devote large amounts of space in our bio of him on his philosophy of spending, even though he may say it's one of his most important beliefs. Likewise with this former presidential candidate. We should certainly mention the LRM and the Triple Curve, but with so little coverage of them in sources we shouldn't give them excess weight. : :

Names I just watched the first four episodes today, and I watch with the subtitles on. It was in English. I noticed some discrepencies between names in the captions, (and how they pronounced it), and thw names is this article. For example Gusto instead of Gust, one can tell they say Gusto too Meipia instead of Maypia Bandra instead of Bandora Neina instead of Neena Ultranate Metal instead of Alternate Metal, pronounced this way as well Raggu instead of Lagu, but what they are saying is the Japanese letter pronounciation that is in between L and R I think that these names should be changed User:BioYu-Gi!

So, for example, Berg and Ostry discuss Kaldor, Barro, Bernajeeb and Duflo etc. All papers which DIDN'T reach the same conclusion as their primary findings. 09:04

" Fladrif: yes, I think this is the point made by a number of respected academics, researchers and psychologists (real ones -) ) In the section on ""cults"" they state that TM is indeed a gateway as well as a mechanism of control (i could have introduced many more respected sources that stated this but did not under accusations the section was to long. This is important. You are of course also completely correct about the ""science of creative intelligence"". this is central to TM's beliefs regarding how the mechanism ""works"" yet it is highly conspicuous by it's absence here. While i always attempt to assume good faith there has been a suspicious amount of NPOV POV Forking in this article - the most clear aspect of this is the TM-Sidhu program which has somehow been split of from this article. The reason of course is that it is difficult to discus this with out mentioning ""science of creative intelligence"". We must I think redress this imbalance, as I am sure all good WIKI editors here are keen to do and dispel any question of POV Forking "

" Speaking of objectivity: while what I said regarding the copula was a plausible argument for using the upper case, the fact is that different people capitalize differently in that particular situation. In fact, I think I checked more sources later and I'm pretty sure a majority of people (Edward Winter included) prefer the lower case in ""Alekhine was white"". (I should really have done that beforehand sorry to distort the picture.) On a somewhat related note (this is something I wanted to tell you and never got a chance to), I will suggest that ""White"" should really only be used as a substitute for a player's name (like our policy says) and never as a substitute for ""the white pieces"" that latter usage (which crops up in phrases like ""Alekhine had White"" or ""played White"") is not documented in any dictionary I checked, including the OED; it should probably be treated as a colloquialism.

":The view that The Greek conception of sex was virile, it took no account whatever of the other, the penetrated was merely an object to be used, a Dover - Foucauldian theory, is no longer unquestioningly accepted. It is actually debunked by Hubbard and James Davidson, among many others. Davidson in particular discusses the biases that led to that view (Dover's well-meaning but homophobic ""defense"" of Greek ""normality"" and Foucault's conflicted attitude towards his own, never admitted, love of being penetrated - a passion which sadly caused his death from AIDS, another fact long hidden by him and his supporters), itself a historical aberration.

At the time of my original edits on the page Liberal Party of Australia, I was unregistered. Since then I have registered, as I mentioned on the talk page. It was on the TALK page; I linked to for people to actually read. Every time I edited (anonymously, I didn't realise I had to register to edit, but my IP address shows I have) they were incorrectly removed by Xtra because they did not match his POV as I have mentioned countless times. Regardless, the data on the wikipedia page is incorrect, and every attempt to change it has been thwarted. - 10:46, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
BC/AD crap It's sad that this website is hijacked by American Christian fundamentalist fascists who can't let go of the fact that Jesus is imaginary and force BC/AD onto every BCE/CE reference. It's not just an atheist point of view that Jesus is nonsense, but also a MAJORITY point of view since most people around the world are NOT Christian and NOT corrupted by Jesus myths.

" I've noticed that as well. That's actually what confuses me the most: If it really is a single, why can't I buy it anywhere? Honestly, I think that if people write it as a ""single"", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album. "
" The term is not controversial in North America either. However, there is a tiny number of political activists who want to attach a stigma or victim status to the world oriental and thereby justify their pandering and prostituting for political gain. They exploit the ignorance of some and the compassion of others to exploit the American political system. This doesn't actually solve any problems, but it does generate a flow of government dollars to their ""cause."" "

" Cluttering royalty articles in the article Line of succession to the Romanian throne, you added middle names, unsupported additional surnames, and whatnot, to the names in list of family members of king Michael. I empathize with your desire to embellish and decorate, but still in my view such details are clutter, in an article where they are just small parts of one list. Could you kindly refrain in the futire from cluttering articles, please. By the way, are you not aware that the invented additional surname ""de Laufenborg"" is commonly laughed at (probably as that son-in-law's fantasy ideas of his promotion to nobility), and king Michael has not used it as part of his granddaughter's name, as far as can be detected from sources of that article.

Concerning the Irreligion Article I wanted to thank you for providing the only rational explanation about the presence of the Christianity portal link on the talk page of the article on irreligion. The bigger religion portal eventually links into all the religions in the Wikipedia, including Christianity, so I still do not see the point of having a separate Christianity portal link. At any rate, I am very reluctant to edit anything, because I believe that Wikipedia has become its own subculture, and one that would take years to learn I do not have time. Again, I appreciate your brief but very helpful message.

" more on ""Disruptive behaviour"" Thank you for your thoughts, especially on your expressed belief in my in-good-faith actions. I've recently discovered (perhaps rediscovered) that the article was possibly semiprotected and that my bold (as per WP:BOLD and perhaps contrary to WP:CYCLE) act of trying to rename it might require some form of consensus on that step. I could take the liberty and not agree with you that I have given a proposal at all, exactly because of my act (without any prior discussion about it) given, and if so, I could conclude that then there was nothing to reject in the first place. Not to mention that the terms overwhelming or even majority are to the least inappropriate, if not even biased. I concur that the argument of temporal proximity of discussions and renamings could be regarded as an arguments for not to rename again, but I think it doesn't suffice. Thank you for the link provided, I cherish the gesture a lot. I could again be free and express my disagreement with your opinion that I have to perform the rename via WP:RM, for I could consider that there is no obligatory procedure to be taken for such an act of renaming. Why, WP:RM is merely a guideline, if it is at all - nothing is stated at the page. Perhaps a project is the right name to select for WP:RM, as it is implied on the page itself. Since, the term project inherently has no attributes of obligation - if not even posesses a certain quality of casualness - I might considered the term has quite different characteristics. But, I honestly appreciate you informing me on this issue. All the best, 's talk "

" In the crowd I frequent, granted a more media savy crowd, I mention obnoxious announcer, or the guy who accents every other word, and they know exactly who I'm talking about and ask ""Who is that guy?"" along with comments like ""Get him off the air."" He is a stand out announcer, even though it is in a negative sensejust the kind of announcer that obnoxious car dealers think will sell their cars. Do people who hide behind anonymity or aliases not deserve mention, or when their name comes public does that negate their ""accomplishments?"" No. Deep Throat was eventually identified. Captain Crunch was identified. The guy that screams and irritates your morning drive across the United States deserves such infamy.

But I wasn't editing any disputed material with the anonymous IP address...I was working on other articles and categories not related to any dispute; I made no personal attacks with the IP address, nor did I leave any 'uncivil' edit summaries. The only real problem leading to my block seemed to be me recreation of Category:Former Jews under a different name (which is entirely OK per Wiki-policy) when I should have taken it to WP:DRV (I'm still learning the policies and procedures around here). Besides that, this indefinite block is entirely uncalled for and is amazingly unfair.

Various anonymous editors (or one editor using various IPs) have added assertions that this school is either the best or most selective in the San Diego area. This may be true, but an assertion like that needs to be backed up by a source. Does the listing of private high schools (Lyons?) call it that? Does the SD Union Tribune call it that? Show us how good a school it is by writing a well-researched and fully cited article about it. Unsupported assertions will just be reverted. - 03:01, Apr 29, 2005 (UTC)

That actually sounds quite reasonable. Keep in mind that I've been blocked largely to prevent me from participating in discussions that were already underway off-Wikipedia before I was blocked. It's refreshing to see some true civility for a change. Especially after having had four different admins block me (actually, it's probably more than the last four), without one word of discussion with me from any of them before doing so. Then there's the whole thing about much of the discussion not being aboveboard, but rather taking place in the modern version of the proverbial smoke-filled back room. Duk and Haukur were decent, and know more about what they're talking about because we've been involved in the same discussions at various times in the past; even I've locked horns with both of them at various times, we've managed to come out of it without permanent hard feelings (can't say that for everyone else involved). Mostly, however, what I've much of anything not even remotely resembling civility, in this entire process. At least not anything close to civility in anything other than a highly ritualized, magic-incantation, Wikipedia-jargon meaning of that term. It's no wonder that so many of them never use that word without linking it; it has nothing whatsoever to do with real-world concepts of civility as they use it. Your proposal was so much in a different vein that it catches me by surprise. The fact that I am surprised might be a cause for concern.

" Nice job on autism causes page Common sense award I think what is on the causes of autism page is well done. I also like your common sense approach. I am not really sure how to send you a message on content but thought I would try this. I see the vitamin D deficiency hypothesis which should be there because it is in the literature, but the hypothesis does not make any sense because oral supplementation of vitmain D among the very young has increased dramatically over the last 20 years and autism increases with it. An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic. I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative. Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia? As you seem to know a lot about autism causes would you have any interest in reviewing it? I could send you a .pdf copy. Hi, . I appreciate your kind words, but causes of autism in fact, most of our autism articles was mostly written by now-departed ; it would need to be a high-quality journal because autism is a featured article, and it would need to be an independent secondary review per our medical sourcing guidelines. In otherwords, there is no need for me to review your book; your work and theory would need to be covered by an independent high-quality journal review of the causes of autism. (Talk) "

are you kidding? Wikipedia has a section on antisemitism for every major figure throughout history. this entire site is pro-israel in every regard. the biggest example is giving New Antisemtism a legitimate page while called the Israeli apartheid an analogy.

" Both IPs are you, per my comments above. There's no room for ""doesn't seem likely.""

I don't even have to provide a diff for that either, since you've obviously looked over that time period in my talk page edit history.

" Reply to Brews ohare Brews, I am fully aware of the difference between kinematics and kinetics. This aticle doesn't need to involve that difference. You quoted above an expression for acceleration. That expression is correct. I am not disagreeing with it. But it tells us absolutely nothing that would enable us to solve a motion problem. To solve a problem in motion, we need an input force. If it only kinematics, we still need an input acceleration. We always need some kinds of contraints or known accelerations before we can determine a trajectory. The solution to your general acceleration equation above is ""Anything"". "

What I do care about, and care about deeply is that the number one-stop shop for knowledge on the internet is even fractionally run by someone like you. This is a serious project, and attitudes like yours aren't needed. You are one of these people who wouldn't last a day on a serious academic venture, but sleazed your way onto Wikipedia and whored yourself as an admin. For you, being an admin is not the gruelling work it should be, its a status symbol. And thats sad. Thats really sad. Now, confront this head on for once in your life.

I know a cite for the Coolac Massacre. Last monday at around 10am, on ABC Radio666 Canberra Morning Show presented by Alix Sloane, Alix had Ian Warden (UC) as a guest. They had a phone in re Australian values and aussie trivia. The show went right across NSW. During it, it was said that the Coolac Massacre happened. The tape of the show should be available. I am sure Alix would oblige.

This IP address has been blocked pending a response to these reasonable questions. The section in question has references and while your disagreement may be reasoned, there is no way for us to know if you keep simply deleting the material wholesale over the objections of others. The block is not intended to last long, just to force yo to talk about your thinking here (where you can still edit). As a collaborative wiki, Wikipedia's good functioning depends on good communication.As well, you might want to read our central, guiding content policy: WP:NPOV. The neutral point of view mandates that we document all points of view, including significant minority points of view, even ones we consider untrue or morally repugnant, all while advocating for none of the points of view (consider the issues of creationism, evolution, or global warming, where either side might see the other as simply wrong; we don't adjudicate between their perspectives, only document them). We can, of course, accurately portray minority or majority points of view as such, though. t

" Well, I see you didn't do much research. I'm talking about the edit I did about pop culture references, how Fat Albert aka Fat Albott was used in an episode of South Park linked right to the episode article. As with other articles listing such examples, it was fine. You can't let your ""preference"" dictate what stays in or out of the article. I will revert it per our discussion, it is not self-promoting, it's not soapboxing, it's not coatracking, it's nothing else you can think of. You didn't even know the edit I was talking about to much such rude assumptions earlier. I asked why you considered it trivial, and it's not listed under ""trivia"" and it may be ""insignificant"" to you, but it ties in ""media"" and ""pop culture"" references about how it's legacy is still referred to (used) today in current shows.

You're right, I did delete the section on the 8th December, after MgeKelly inserted the Monty Burns factoid. He was possibly trying to get me to lose my temper, and he unfortunately succeeded. The sequence of events thus runs this way. You create a compromise. Mgekelly vandalizes the article with the Monty Burns factoid. I deleted the whole section and reinserted the factoid in the main body. Please note that I deleted the section two days ''after you created it, on the 6th. Note that I was on wikipedia on the 7th, I saw the section then, and did not touch it. So:I should not have deleted the whole section, I should have deleted only the Monty Burns vandalism, and I apologize for not having appreciated your early effort at a compromise. 03:43, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)

" Century formats Re: Alcohol laws of New Jersey. If you have a problem with centuries being spelled out (nineteenth and twentieth instead of 19th and 20th) you probably shouldn't have pointed to a policy (WP:CENTURY) that allows either form (in this case spelling it out) only requiring that usage be consistent. Claiming that the official title of a legislative act (TEA-21) that uses 21st (one mention that is not our writings and is something out of our control), is grounds for reverting 6 others in an article that is already ""internally consistent"" as you put it, that is disingenuous and some would consider it disruptive editing. If you have any further comments, raise it on the talk page. This is not a matter of ownership, it's just that these petty format issues (whether it be dates, centuries spelled or numbered, etc.) are aggravating and unnecessary, and it's audacity to insist upon it when your claims for it are baseless. This contact is a courtesy and will be my one and only time. If you continue to revert, this will become a matter for WP:ANI. "

" Re: How to pronounce maize? How do you pronounce maize? - ""maze"" (rhymes with days) or ""mize"" (rhymes with eyes)? This needs to be made apparent, and does not seem to have been addressed (except perhaps for those readers who are conversant with the special symbols denoting pronunciation, which the casual reader is not). 72.73.250.57 Re: How to pronounce maize? My apologies - It appears that there is an attempt on the page to explain how to pronounce maize - there is an ""ei"" reference where the ""ei"" appears to be in a different font from the rest of the the sentence, and that corresponds to a rhyming with ""days"" (i.e., not rhyming with ""eyes""). But to the first-time reader this is easy to overlook. Perhaps with further experience with the Wikipedia pages, I will not be so quick to jump to these conclusions of inadequacy. But for now, suffice it to say that a casual browser of these pages can quite easily make the same mistake(s) that I have. In other words, it seems like a simple statement like ""rhymes with ..."" would prevent such waste of time and resources. Again, my apologies...""mea culpa"". 72.73.250.57 "

The categories are there to guide the encyclopaedia to provide information to the public. This allows people to reference categories. Particularly relevant in politics. Among a number of things is to allow people to do searches. I found this entry because of listening to the radio and there is a religion in politics debate. I wanted to know who is an atheist in the debate and who is religious. Also Euthanasia is a big issue and as health minister it is good to know what religion she is.

First of all, who the fuck died and made you the god on what is and what is not plagiarism? It seems like a pretty clear cut case to me. If text from the article matches text found in another source word for word, then it seems fairly clear cut that it is plagiarized. I would also point out, again, for like the umpteenth fucking time, that this user has been using plagiarized material repeatedly and only takes it out after being beaten over the head with it. Secondly, dont you fucking dare try and threaten me with what might and might not be said in arbitration. Finally, in case you were not aware or just did not care, an AOL IP cannot be blocked, so that is not any threat for the anon. 23:12, Feb 10, 2005 (UTC)

" I simply meant that sterilizing those with Down Syndrome would do nothing to ""improve the race"" or lessen the incidence of the condition. I'm unsure of the eugenicists' actual position on the syndrome, but considering some of the minor conditions they used to classify people as ""unfit"" (some well within the ""normal"" variance of human genetics), it seemed likely that they would have considered Down sufferers as unfit, and therefore candidates for segregation or sterilization. It would have been unjustified and fruitless, that's my point. "
Admin Conspiracy It seems like the admins are abusing their powers. Since my account has been blocked from editing anything, I cannot even edit my user page. Also, since my account is locked, i cannot talk on the talk pages.
" that's nice. go fuck yourselves, idiots. the fact that you can't absorb reality is no sweat off my back. you lose, i still win. good luck with your ""wikipedia fuckfest"" hahaha."

" What the hell has happened to you??? Why are you being so rude towards me? Yes, I know I did not do them properly, which is my mistake but there is no need for you to be rude to me. I have never ever been like that with you so why are you acting like with me? By saying what your saying, your attacking me personally and you could be blocked for what you say. I cannot believe that you'd say something like that to me. I know we had that huge spat before but I thought we were civil towards each other. Your definently out of line here and yes I will complain to the admin should you carry on. It's not your article mate, so for you to say that Im not improving it is totally wrong. As for me ""annoying you"", I haven't done anything to upset you or anyone else, so don't be unpleasant in what you say. "

Need for sympathy towards the too many anti-Christian violence articles There is a question of garnering donations from America and Europe with sob stories of anti-Christian violence, involved in the large number of articles being posted on anti-Christian violence in India, with seperate articles for each and every incident for whatever reason on anyone bearing a seemingly Christian name. This is good for India also because it brings in foreign direct investment. I have therefore, decided not to induce any more NPOV in this and similar articles because they are only belly-filling exercises by resourceful missionaries; and as such deserve sympathy.

Re: illogical: Supervening influences on half life of samples I understand that the half-life of a radio-isotope is unaffected by temerature, pressure, etc. But don't other radiological sources have an effect? e.g. the atomic fallout from a meteorite or a supernova in a nearby star system. It seems such events could trigger substantial 'non-spontaneous' decay that would cause is discontinuity in the typical half-life curve and set dates off by an order of magnitude. Also the level of C-14 in the atmosphere could increase significantly in response to such events too: making a sample appear younger than it really is. No? Are there any reliable sources research on this?

":Please read my statement again, carefully. I did not block you because of your contributions at RFA. I disagree with them, but that is beside the point entirely. I blocked you because of your allusions to pedophilia in your post on AN. The only connection RFA has with this block is that the AN discussion resulted from the dispute there. While there was a fair amount of suboptimal contributions from several editors at that RFA, nothing said there was block-worthy. It was the attack on AN, and the specific verbiage employed, that earned the block. As I (and others) have said, you chose wording that was deliberately inflammatory, rather than neutral wording which would have conveyed the same idea, and even your revision of the first sentence wouldn't fix the problem with the rest of the post.

While we need to be careful how we use the logos of organisations and television channels, the guidelines you are referring to above on how not to use the logo are in fact referring to the BBC logo rather than that of BBC One. If you would like to contact the BBC and ask whether using a black version of the BBC One logo is acceptable then we can truly sort out which image is best.
It aids verifiability to include quotes, especially for material that is likely to be challenged. I'm not aware of the MPA style. Do you mean APA style? The style you're using, Wikipedia calls shortened notes. My suggestion was to link the notes to the references using . This can also be done using wikilinks (which I've never used, but could try). It's not strictly necessary, but is helpful. Since I'm not very good at research, I was offering to perform this nitpicky task.

Frankly, Alienus, I was about to voice my support of halving the duration, on the basis that while it was inappropriate, offense might not have been intended. Then I read the preceding comment, and I see the familiar protests of complete innocence, and defiant tone. That doesn't seem compatible with an acceptance that your words did cause offense (regardless of intent), and a willingness to make an effort to avoid doing so in future. For what it's worth, then, I oppose a reduction of the block, though I may change this view in future.

Wasn't there also an entry from before on this page about MCR1 have a pleitropic effect on personality traits, supposedly going in line with the idea of redheads being fiery? I don't know. From personal experience, I've never met a single redhead who fit in with this, and just one or two who came off as ditzy or goofy.
The see also section does need cleaning up, I attempted a few times but it's tricky as we can't include anything that's already in the article, which is a bit strange considering the umbrella nature of the subject matter.
" Hadith's of the prophet Mohammed sallalahu alayhi we sellem Esselamu aleikum we rahmetullah brother Do you know what hadith means? Why did u revert my edits when they are not in discrepancy with the etymology, i have translated the word....... the word doesn't mean ""tradition"" ok? There's another word in arabic which means tradition. What business do you have editing islam topics you not being muslim, and if you are muslim how can you not know what hadith is........ so please go edit some athiest posts.... now if u are muslim go get a hadith book and leanr what it is and quit spreading lies about tradition, ok? If you keep spreading this lie may God break your leg... thankx... are you afraid?~"

However the way I read its helicopter controls to work flying with one proprotor assembly would be almost impossible. Not only do the two rotors counter torque forces, but they appear to oppose each other while maneuvering (ie to yaw right, the right prop rotor moves back, the left one forward). Could this be what some people mean by one one engine, even if it's technically incorrect?

As Justin is pro-Sahrawi, I'll invite him here and I think he can comferm everything I'm about to tell you. That article's scope is Western Sahara, not just the SADR, it's simply mis-titled, note that it also includes the Spanish Sahara CoA. See the first two paragraphs of my 18 March post at wp:NPOV Noticeboard#Flag_and_Coat_of_arms_of_Western_Sahara_.2F_SADR, and Talk:Coat_of_arms_of_the_Sahrawi_Arab_Democratic_Republic#Move.3F. In sort tough: During the flag/CoA merges, with CoA articles it was the WS article that was merged into the SADR one, as the SADR article contained nearly all the significant edit history. It was given a WS title via a Technical move request. Someone (not going to unnecessarily publicize his name) has been trying to unilaterally re-split the articles, even tough he's the only one who thinks that should be done and everyone else who has an opinion thinks that there should be one article. He had the Technical move of the merged article undone, on the procedural baces that he objected to it, as a prelude to atemping to unilaterally split the article against conciseness. His split was undone by Dzlinker and myself, hence the poor title which doesn't match the scope. If on the other hand you think the article gives the Moroccan regional CoA's too much WP:WEIGHT or somthing, that's another matter, and you could discuss it at the NPOV Noticeboard, or maybe the article talk page.
" The sense I indicated has been understood. Ergo, my edits are in fact a sensible statement. The correct conclusion, either way, was to delete the sentence as it was irrelevant. The separate comment about psycholgical literature whether contradictory or oxymoronic renders, again, the same sense and conclusion. The wider issue on whether ""psycholgical literature"" is contradictory or oxymoronic (the same thing) is also met, whether understood by the editor or not - serendipitous for that person I suppose, or good intuition at least."

Are you comparing China/Nazi propaganda committees to Israel's public relation campaign? The Nazis and Chinese didn't go international and seek the presence of foreign signatories, no they simply supressed (i.e, executed, tortured, imprisoned, etc..) those who violated x rule. They defined propaganda in it's most obvious form, but to compare to Israel...weird. I'm not denying this isn't propaganda, but mentioning it without overwhelming RS support and affirmation from non-oped is crucial. We might as well tag PCHR, AJ, and practically all Human Rights groups in the article - all of which have been accused of propaganda tactics during this war. Just because BBC or some other international sites alluded that Israel is promoting a state of propaganda is incredibly POV.

But you changed college logo with the heading ""Color correction"". I am regular student of this college and official representative of my college. That color change which you think is not true representation of our college. You changed the college logo color with blue one, which our official color is ""Dark Navy Blue"" as is given in my uploaded batch which you removed. Please could I ask why? I am not an expert in wiking, i also don't know how to roll back your suggested image, i am a doctor, but this is some kind of illegal.

Yes, I had already read a more detailed account of what happened, but thought that these details are better located in the article on the history of Romania. Also, again, what I wrote doesn't seem to conflict with what you wrote ie Romania surrendered, but didn't ratify the Peace Treaty. After all, the US never ratified the Treaty of Trianon, but this doesn't mean that the treaty wasn't valid. 11:58, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)

" I don't think that you understand that all of the information that you've obtained from your ""sources"" (most of which are defunct) originally obtained that information from Clan Young Officers. If wikipedia's point is to be historically accurate, you must remove this page along with many other pages about Clans that were founded recently. If your point is to rehash a list of Scottish Clans, you need to relax a little and accept data from the sources that created the data. I'll say this very slowly: Clan Young was founded in 1988. It never existed before that. Now... please explain to me why YOUR opinion about ""Og"" may stand while the opinion of a Past President of Clan Young does not. Because it comes from an out of print $250 paperback written by someone who merely obtains material for travel guides from legitimate publications such as provided by Douglas (http://clanyoung.com/). In any case, Since ""Og"" is now acceptable, perhaps you'd like to clear up the smears applied to me by that jackass, Brianann MacAmhlaidh, and maybe transfer and apply the bans and reprimands to him...

" Money in the Bank means you can go after any title, any time, any place. As Edge showed last year when (as a Raw wrestler) he appeared on Smackdown to beat the Undertaker for the World Title. As Wiki's own article for MITB states, ""the briefcase holder...can appear on any of the 3 shows to allow the case holder the chance to cash in"". WWE has plainly stated that the case holder can pick his own spot at his own time frame to cash in. Having that case gives CM Punk the specific right to be on Raw whenever he chooses, so he is given the chance to cash in (if he wants to do so).

Further comment: I think that your proposal would qualify as an uncontroversial page move. Even if nobody responds to this, I support that it'd be ok to go ahead with the move. I doubt anyone would care.
Conflict with the SEO Community I don't have a problem with a section about this being included, as long as it isn't given undue weight. I think the section should be reinserted, but the comment about an outcry from the respectable SEO community should be removed unless there are better sources. I would normally think that the link to Patel's blog should be removed as well, but since it's also linked to directly from the second Calacanis link, it's probably ok. After having taken more time to look at this, my removal of the entire section did appear to be unnecessary. I saw some random removals, some false edit summaries, and that the section was being sourced only by 6 blog links. Dil

Administrators Administrators are those who are responsible for the Majority of vandalism on Wikipedia. I have relinquished my position as an admin over a decade ago over abuses of the use, or rather the abuse of Wikipedia. All the original editors quit their position, leaving a void in which the little men who were put down by people like me became the new admins; these individuals did not know what they were contributing to, but rather were mindless incantations of the new generation.

After the Afd ended, Karmosin vandlaized then blanked the page in question, then out of retaliation flagged a page which had just completed Afd that morning for a second Afd process. I want 1. the Afd revered on page Gadugi and Karmosin sanctioned for violating wiki/Wales policy of We Are Nice People Who Do Not Act This Way. On his user page his lists himself as a ""rebel"" which isn't something that fits in with Wiki's peaceful honeybee meme. While I respect all peoples right to their views and opinions, after an Afd completes, nominating pages out of retaliation in an attempt to oppress the majority is improper. I would like this user punished for 1) violating policies and 2) wasting yet more of my valuable time answering stupid and frivolous Afd requests and 3) interfering with me writing more articles. =="

""Criminal negligence."" A person acts with criminal negligence with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he fails to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. The risk must be of such nature and degree that the failure to perceive it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.69.74.180.19 "
At WP:DRN we volunteers have a fairly broad discretion within DRN to do whatever we think will best resolve the conflict (we have that freedom because we have zero authority and you can freely ignore us), and in my considered opinion, the combination of you filing the dispute with a nonexistent article name, you filing as an IP when you have a user name, and the preliminary reaction of the other editors named, led me to believe that the dispute would be more likely to be resolved if you refiled with the right article name and with you logged in. As for the rights of IP users vs logged in users, yes, editing semi-protected articles is one difference (neither group can edit fully protected articles) but that is not the only difference. See Wikipedia:IPs are human too#What an unregistered user can't do for a complete list. In your case, the problem is not the IP, but rather editing under two different accounts (logged in and not logged in). When registered users sign out of their accounts and contribute under their IP address, it makes it difficult to see their true editing history. Because of this, I am asking you to please sign in before filing DRN disputes.

Wikipedia is such a joke, only certainly political material is allowed, all other material is censored. Stop acting like a fool.71.232.157.145
Further note: I have undone your changes at Template:UK-academic-bio-stub. You unfortunately tried to create an article in a template, which is the wrong way to do it - that particular template is used on lots of articles to show that the information is about a UK academic and can be expanded. Your changes meant that, for a while, every article using the template was displaying your notes about Edith Hall! If you want to create an article about an academic, and you think that they are sufficiently notable (check the guidance at Wikipedia:Notability (academics)) then go ahead - but on a new page, not in a template! Have a look at Help:Starting a new page for more information. Hope all this makes sense. Regards, Talk

hey idiot quit fucking with the sentry gun page. you leave in links to other peoples sites but through your blatant hypocrisy you take mine out. what is my site about? sentry guns. well god damn, that couldn't be any more relevant could it? it all boils down to opinions. you have your opinion of what's relevant and i have mine. all it is is your opinion nothing more. it is no more legitimate than the opinion of anyone else. the problem is, for no reason of any validity, you've been given extra abilities. you're still the same idiot, but with more of a vote. go fuck yourself. you have no sense of unbiased logic. i do not care about what you think is appropriate or not as you are irrelevant.

" The above paragraph illustrates that the axis to this entire debate is your misunderstanding of WP:SELF. More specifically: your mistaken definition of ""reference"". WP:SELF seeks to avoid encyclopediac references. This means that all the facts of all articles come from the source and never from another article. The reason for this is clear. You, however, choose to define ""reference"" very liberally, and take it to mean that Wikipedia should never include anything about Wikipedia, which of course is silly. Somehow you've come to believe you are the last word on what is and is not relevant, despite press coverage and vast consensus to the contrary. McCarthyism is alive and well on Wikipedia. What's funny is these little witch hunts for irrelevance are so restricted in scope, and totally arbitrary in their focus. Do us a favor and go take your fervor over to Christina Aguilera. "
You are being incredibly dishonest by arguing it is not only mainstream among some groups. IT IS! Only among cultural and physical anthropologists, everywhere else it is not. So stop beating around the bush already and present your version of the sentence.
" One can insert, in context, a cost at one point. For instance, ""The 'one-time-buy' of M16A1 rifles by the US Army was for a unit cost of $100."" Even then, contracts are not exact either. A contract can have penalties, incentives, delivery costs, support costs, development costs, and an absurd array of factors which make any one number meaningless. Take the B-2 (if you're fond of aircraft. Prices for individual planes hovered between $277m and $1.1b depending on who you asked. Prices, when they included the cost of development and support infrastructure have topped $3 billion. That's a lie, of course. If you were to have added one bomber to the end of the production run, it would have cost around $350m extra. Is that the actual cost of the bomber then? "

Ignore his silly requests. He thinks the Linear title is a joke & bogus yet a crappy magazine's belt actually means something. The strangest thing about this noob is that the only reference to his claim of Jones being the real champion is the alphabet titles, yet he claims Hopkins is the real champion now despite Hopkins holding none of the belts. The Robinson comparison is a completely pointless & irrelevent statement. The title Hopkins picked up was an unofficial meaningless magazine's title.

Go ahead, defend the status quo held up by the mainstream media that says that all males are guilty of rape and all females should not be named, even though over half of rape accusations are false. You know Julian Assange does a better job reporting on what's really going on than mainstream media? So you would rather defend the media which blinds us to the truth, by hiding the names of false accusers, and hiding the truth about what our governments are doing? You are nothing but a pathetic sheep, which does not surprise me coming from a Wikipedia mongrel. You care more about the status quo than about the truth, and for that, you are scum.

" Yiannis Kotsiras deletion You are listed as deleting his page because of ""unambiguous copyright violations"". However, the website you attribute the copyright to (discoogle.com) itself credits Kotsiras.gr, the artist's website. You'll find the same biography there, though with fewer errors. (The writing demonstrates idiosyncrasies common to Greeks when they write in English, so it is unlikely it was cribbed from elsewhere.) If I google a musician's name, such as Bill Frisell, I will find dozens of websites with the same biography. That's because the content came from a P.R. release. I work in publishing and have never heard of anyone copyrighting such a thing. Obviously, there is no copyright infringement. So can we have the article back, please? This is the second time that I know of that his biography has been deleted and I imagine Kotsiras has better things to do than struggle in English with replacing it constantly. He is the most famous singer in Greece and we deserve to know about him. I am an inveterate user of Wikipedia and I had to go to the Greek language version to get the information. "

Pretentious bastards."
" Why do you think that animal liberation movement is a ""fringe"" term? It gets 38,000 Google hits. Why should the lead include the phrase ""animal rights activists?

Lest someone mistakenly visit a talk page, expecting to read some truth and hence be confused reading this gentleman's comment and mistaking the writer for someone who knows what they're talking about, I'd just like to point out the above explanation for the word ""handicap"" is complete bollocks. handicap has meant ""to place at a disadvantage"" for a long long time. According to Merriam Webster, the etymology is ""Etymology: obsolete English handicap, a game in which forfeit money was held in a cap, from hand in cap"", which obviously has nothing at all to do with being ""Handy with a cap"" or even related to the disabled. Certain individuals may have a negative connotation with the use of the term, which happens merely due to the words close association with 1960's era community welfare practices, but that is an individuals choice to associate negativity with the word, not the words fault at all.

Energy use in society includes sources of energy used for heating, transportation and electricity. Electricity is in fact a way of intermediating energy from the original sources ( such as burning something or using the potential energy of falling water ) to the point of use. It is unfortunately common but also misleading and wrong to talk about aspect of energy use in society as only including electricity when other uses such as gas for heating and cooking and gasoline/diesel for transportation are used as well.

" The lead already says the first description of it's external appearance appeared in 2012. Perhaps I could add ""published"" in there somewhere to make it clear. Still not sure how to reread what you were referring to above: ""Until 2012, nothing was known about this species other than cranial and dental anatomy."" Again, to be clear, we could add ""published about its external appearance""? Or is that too wordy? Or maybe reword the sentence altogether. What do you think? "

" I assume good faith on your part, UserQuiddity, because you have always been a gentleman. Accordingly either you are mistaken, or Wikipedia is subject to easy fandalism, because the facts, as I know them are substantially different from your presentation. The page in question is Jewish Bolshevism, which is a so called noun + adjetive expression (according to Wikipedians). The fact is that those who explain or justify the hatred of Jews are crackpots and Antisemites. My position is simple: Jewish Bolshivism has only an antisemitic meaning, interpretation, usage, justification, etc. I am not responsible for the fact that that Draius/red (whatever his difficult to remember name is) user deduced that I have insulted him. The insult was his own deduction. I did not hurl at him any insult. And that term popsucker is just my paraphrase of the other dofficult Wiki word for a Wikipedia who disguises his identity. I am not allowed to name any of the people I suspect - what's that word, I don't know, and I do not wish to waste my time looking for it - it sounds something like suckpoper - can you help me out on this? Also, I can no longer locate the Wikipedia linked expression Don't be a dick. Can you please provide me with the link to it. Also, it would be helpful if you located that link to that ""popsucker"" term. It was user:Noetica who suspected a pop-x to be disguising himself as such. And [[Yours truly"

another article ive stumbled across of debatable notability, looks like it needs to be deleted
Or may be someone is trying to distort it. I do not thin it is a nightmare to sort out. On one hand it is bing said that Ibbetson as per Wiki policies is not a reliable source, then his reference is used here. Other references are ignored. And now this line which to me seems to suggest is that some people in that area were considered as or recognized as Sainis due to their marriage with Malis where as sources have showed the other way around that Malis were called Malis and then adopt Saini name as per Census report and Jodhpur king letting them do so. More this line that have mentioned above should not be used as it does not have any citation and is against the Wiki policies.
That is all I ask for now.

I understand quite well how evolution is supposed to work. I understand the capriciousness and contingencies in the workings of evolution. It is the paragraph in question, especially the example in that paragraph, which distorts the workings of evolution. The phrase it need only increase at a rate of 0.005 cm per generation (= 50 cm/10,000) easily gives the impression of progressive linear change. The anthropocentric notions of directionality and purpose often (I assume inadvertently) find their way into the writings of specialists who attempt to explain various forms of Darwinian evolution. From these I have often read how evolution invents various forms and functions. Carl Sagan, in my opinion one of the worst offenders in these matters, injected anthropocentric notions on a massive scale so as to justify his idea of a million highly advanced technological civilizations in the Galaxy. I read your paragraph as suffering from the same notions of directionality.

Why should I pay any attention to anything you say? Besides Verbal, you are more responsible for creating this situation than anyone else. Though Verbal was clearly doing as much warring as I was, you sided with him and blocked me from the only article I care to edit. You are an administrator who enables the bad behavior of other operators Wikipedia addicts like Verbal who have no contribution to make except to attack articles they don't like and make trouble for other editors. You are part of the problem. I've looked at your talk page, and your decisions are entirely capricious and without a doubt biased in favor of the editors that you favor. Wikipedia is a totally fucked up place, and it's people like you who are keeping it fucked up.
Most of the comments on that AfD were votes, not counterpoints. Further, how can you say that the article doesn't mandate deletion when they clearly never addressed the points of NOR, and V. My greatest concern about the article is the associations with living biographies. In all of that debate they have not verified a single notable alumni member. This was the reason I originally nominated the article as they had associated themselves with Justice Rothstein of Canada. I can only imagine the kind of revert warring that is going to take place on that article when I continue to remove all of the uncited associations. I hope this isn't the beginning of a movement to include every student club in wikipedia. As for your remarks about the closing afd, despite the fact that I feel I did not have an opportunity to respond to the remarks posted I will let it go as I see your point about perception of points considered.

I guess you haven't read ""What is Property,"" but basically he takes various arguments for property from past luminaries, and argues that they all imply that equality should prevail. "

I Should be Surprised Take 2 But I'm not. Its exactly the kind of spineless response I anticipated from you. Look Schumin, I don't care about you remotely. I'm not here to bring you some sort of pain, I don't care anything, at all about you. What I do care about, and care about deeply is that the number one-stop shop for knowledge on the internet is even fractionally run by someone like you. This is a serious project, and attitudes like yours aren't needed. You are one of these people who wouldn't last a day on a serious academic venture, but sleazed your way onto Wikipedia and whored yourself as an admin. For you, being an admin is not the gruelling work it should be, its a status symbol. And thats sad. Thats really sad. Now, confront this head on for once in your life. Maybe your mother told you to ignore problems and they go away. I think you should confront your problem and apologise for your actions. 86.45.202.183 (talk)

Just for the record, I'm not saying that you are betty. I have no idea whether or not your are, but I am very clear that users who appear from nowhere and immediately start involving themselves in wikipolitics have no place whatsoever on this project.

In Poland now, 62 years after the war ended, there's a project to establish how many people really died... ROUGHLY (including how many were killed by the Soviets). The Auschwitz museum now says 1.1 million people died at the camp - it used to say it was 4 million (these from all over the Europe, so semi-related). If you remember, the classic work of Holocaust denial is Did Six Million Really Die? The correct answer is: no one knows, but probably many more (right now it's not only the Jews counted). What happened in Srebrenica is established in a little detail compared to, say, what happened at Auschwitz (being the symbol of the Holocaust).

" Background section At the present time, the ""background"" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to ""take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case."" The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them. If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date. The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as ""a homemade clock"" or ""an invention"". The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went ""viral"", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media. Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

No Such User's Opinion Not sure if you're able to comprehend, but here are few facts to consider Serbia was not a country during Selimovi's life. Neither was Bosnia and Herzegovina. Yugoslavia was. He was a partisan and a communist, and has fought for Yugoslav union in WW2 and thereafter Selimovi's declaration letter came in 1976, when he was 66, and it came as a result of conflicts and harrasment he had in Sarajevo Serbian language is just a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, which is a linguistic unit. Statements on trial of Slobodan Miloevi are not a relevant, reliable source for wikipedia. Biographies by relevant, nuanced biographers, such as Hayden or Crnkovi are. Do you really think you're the first editor who came here to demand that we coy to requests for his uniquely Serbian / Bosniak nationality (cross the unnecessary) spoken in angry rants? The archives are full just of that nationalist crap. More sane and neutral editors, where I unhumbly count myself, reached a tacit agreement to go for outside sources, downplay his ethnicity crap, and tell the bullies like yourself to fuck off.

" You guys are of the opinion that if things do not go YOUR way, your response is ""Well, fuck those guys. I don't care what they think."" You guys take yourselves way to seriously, in my opinion. If someone disagrees with your decision to on an edit, then you block them or ban them. Some jerk, whom I can't remember (not you two guys), even has some kind of graph on his talk page showing how many times his talk page has been vandalized, like that is something to be proud of. Such a meter is really a measure of just how much the community hates you and what an asshole you must be. That makes about as much sense as saying, ""I've had my front windows busted out 50 times this week. That must mean I'm doing something! No! It does not! That just means that at least 50 were super angry enough at you to take time out of their day to go mess you up. How many more equally hate you, but just don't want to take the time to toss a brick through your window / talk page? Millions of people come here each day and you guys think that a ""consensus"" one or two or three other editors agreeing with you on something. And how do you know that those three other consensus makers aren't just as stupid as you are?? 3 or 4 out of 100's of thousands of editors?

A couple image suggestions I just saw your request for images at WPDC. I work in DC and can try and get some if you give me the list I will see what I can do. I may take me a while though. I don't get up there very often and its knowwhere near a metro stop. Also, works at the Library of Congress and might have some ideas and used to work for the US Army Center of Military History and might have a point of contact of someone who would be willing to look for them there.

Eagle, he's just a POV pusher. He was trying to strip the information out of the article, and started chain-reverting in order to do it. He's STILL lying and saying that the only Muslim nations with religious police are Saudi Arabia and Iran. Either he's just willfully ignorant or he is deliberately trying to push a very specific POV, and he seems not to care at all about facts.
It was my intention that you stop being a dick and use the template on the Image Workshop pages. A second's worth of contemplation on your part would show you that your method is stupid on those particular pages, so if your method is stupid would it not be a good idea to use a method that isn't stupid, that does work and has done so for a very long time?
The Reason for This Edit War Ah...Diyako, just as I suspected. So, that`s what this is all about. About the Kurds. Hhmm, well you Diyako have almost entirely devoted your edits to articles involving the Kurds. Heja Helwelda has almost a 98 percent edit history in articles involving the Kurds. And, you guys have brought in all these Iranian, and other editors in, that are forced to defend all these hypothesis and allegation made against these articles about Iran. I also noticed that Heja Helwelda had made 3/4 of the history section that you guys are now disputing in this article about a genetics study about Kurds. I personally erased that because it did not belong here, in an article about Iranian people, and it also did not have an authoritative refrences-and then, after I did that a war ensued. Hhhm, it is starting to make sense now.

I never proposed whitewash (i.e., Peluchon's draft). I proposed cutback or stub as per WP:ATTACK, which is close to a perfect fit; BLP applies on a sliding scale to small corps, and in this case it was decided that the CEO is a nonnotable redirect, so anything that reflects badly on the principals should be treated similarly to BLP to some degree. Only good sourced balanced data should appear. I think the rest of your question should probably be referred to my talk also. As near as I can tell, all talk onwiki about five figures is rumormongering and fails V (insofar as it applies to project space). (It just occurred to me, maybe Mr Laurent doesn't have the money but he can certainly string out a cheap publicity stunt without it. Anyway there are many explanations and no hard facts.) Deferring to a longer answer later, I think WP:DUCK applies. Tell me, am I editing constructively or not by asking that the article's subject be rightly legally identified according to authoritative sources? (I will be happy to add more other constructive edits to my edit history but I don't know how that would help much.) Sure we can talk court cases, after we know what corporation(s) the court case is about. Will anyone agree with me that the clause that CFTC corrected last month can now be corrected by us this month? C'mon, that's easy.

" If you have the information, so add them. As I'm living in Europe I don't know much about US releases. Mango is an interesting label. When CDs came on the market, a numebr of US releases (reggae, Carribean and African music only) were distributed here in Europe with prefixes CCD (for CDs) (I've seen a list where K7s had the prefix MLPS (???). The numbers followed - for records originally released until ca. early 1980s - the UK-Island numbers, but then continued at 9xxx with a continuous numbering independently. I'll search for my old list. Mango in the UK started in 1985 as far as I see - using the Island numbering (e.g. 12"": Third World: ""Now That We've Found love"" released in one mix on the Island label and in another one on a Mango label, later they released new material with prefixes CIDM and numbers from 1000 onwards. ... There are also 4th&B;'way and Antilles as two more mayor sub labels ... Thank you for your work, ! "

Cyde seems to think since he's an admin, everything he chooses not to like can be Speedied, and it will go through with little resistance, due to his connections high above. You not only do NOT have a neutral point of view, but i think you are nothing more than a troll, to cause hell on wikipedia for your own amusement. Well, i think it's time his cushy ride ends.

Virodhi Himsa Adhyatma You deleted a page that should not have been deleted. Indian chronicles has made many threats against our religion claiming his Jain sect have all the answers and we are wrong. I have outside contact with him and I am getting Law enforcement involved for his harrasment tactics. I think you guys should atleast research what the doctors you support say about Virodhi Himsa Adhyatma. There is no information on Rishi Burgess in the article nor just cause for deletion. Please reconsider. It will offend thousands of people. Virodhi Himsa Adhyatma is instructed as a college course also so its easy to verify. It can be verified going back thousands of years. Please do not side with one Jain view and not another. If you feel something should be changed just point it out and it will be done.

You're a little bitch You are a sad person who spends her whole life on wikipedia. You have no mates. Despite my edits I do actually have a life outside of wikipedia. I have lots of mates and lots of hobbies such as football and tennis. I'm also very intelligent as I have 9A*s in my GCSEs (all in proper subjects). So how dare YOU patronise me. From the timings of your edits (eg: 10:13, 14:39 etc) clearly all you do all day is edit wikipedia. It's all you have. Nothing else in your sad, pathetic life. (and u say ur a nerd). That's quite unhealthy if you ask me. And yes I do think a little girl is sweet and cute. She's extreemly sweet and adorable. Nobody could possibly fail to think so. I also think rabbits are sweet and cute. It doesn't mean I want to fuck them up the arse. Ask most people whether a)they think rabbits are cute and sweet b)if they fancy them and most people would give an answer of yes to a) and no to b). (except AnemoneProjectors who'd say yes to both). My point is clear you can think something/someone is sweet without fancying them. So how dare you acuse me of being a paedophile. I should sue you for slander (or is it libel...) but seeing as you probably live in a bedsit without a job there doesn't seem much point. At the very least you should be blocked for such a viscous personal attack and stopped from being an admin. By the way, adorableness is not a word you stupid motherfucking little cunt.
I fail to understand why people immediatly jump to the conclusion that the game ended just like that, thinking the story was over. To put sophisticatedly and wikipedialy though, most of the complainers are in the North America region, where the people have a thirst for complaining so deep that it clouds their interpretation.

Sorry but I don't follow you at all. How are scientific discoveries made in the UK not relevant to a section on science and technology in the UK? How are British writers not relevant to a section on British literature? How are British musicians not relevant to a section on British music? How are British philosophers not relevant to a section on British philiosophy? A few examples of Hollywood films based upon British stories and events seems to me highly relevant to the cinema section, particularly since the British and American film industries are so closely connected. If your comment is that these sections could be better written, then perhaps I can agree. All of your comments regarding content I completely disagree with however.

" You display your ignorance. The dim bulb in question was paranoid and he was stupid, the classic definitions without a shade of exaggeration. An accurate description isn't an insult, censor. Why you people feel the need to interfere when you don't understand is beyond me. When cletus wrote his stupid paranoid schlock viz ""I do not support the interjection of ""However, this accomplishment was short live."" That does not make sense. That sentence takes away from his great accomplishment. It infers that he did something wrong or something happened and he did not act. It has a negative connotation. What is the point of that sentence? There should be an entire section devoted to his accomplishment of paying off the national debt. Subtle propaganda The diction does not make sense and should be changed or removed."" That is paranoid and stupid. In fact if you're censoring me surely that garbage should also have been censored on the grounds that it is incoherent babble or whatever euphemism you censors use."

Trim and Polish == On reflection, the 19th Century section actually is a bit bloated with non-relevant stuff. The issue of slavery being based on assumed inferiority is obviously core to the controversy, but there is also a lot of waffle including arbitrary observations and one guy who merely quoted Herodotus in his dictionary. This section is basically the longest in the article, and it thus gives undue weight to stuff that is not really core. I propose to thin this section down to focus on the controverial issue around slavery. Any objections? Herodotus is in the Classical section and is quoted from Du Bois. Regarding the length of that 19th section, I have no comments for the moment. Actually, I see other sections with the same length. ==

If the US stopped the illicit cocaine trade I would personally have a lot more sympathy for the country but while they refuse to do so, preferring to pursue businessman like the NatWest Three (an article I began) and invade countries like Iraq my own feelings also harden (lots of ""businessmen"" with their machine guns here purely thanks top US dollars). Instead of striving for a united Americas the US build a wall to divide the continent. In terms of the article the only thing that counts is whether it is NPOV and accurate, "
HELLO Liberal MAGGOT Just want to let you know Rob, I'm still around, watching and putting together my plans to deal with wikipediots, like you. I see, from some of the others that posted on your talk page, You seemed to have develop a rather nice fan club... Tread carefully, your internet actions will have consequences. See that dork, David, the son of Mike Kernell, Democratic State Rep from Tennessee U,see here and his run in with the FBI... Liberal maggots, like you ROB and your BEER AND NEW AGE GOTHEANEN DICKHEAD bud, can't win on augment, so you all have to use Chicago street thuggery and censorship, and Ratfucking to win... You, and your kind are thugs and Maggots... If you consider this a personal attack on you ROB, the answer is - yes. But you use Wikipeida to personally attack others, including myself, and my friends, so I have no moral compunctions to to show you Reciprocity (social psychology) in this. Your shadow Joe.

" Well, there are definitely copyright problems. This edit includes blatant copy-pasting (as, evidently, did this). This one is uncomfortably close: Source text Article textAccording to a source close to Honey Singh, when the rapper received a call from Bhardwaj, he thought it was a prank, more so when he was told it was for song written by Gulzar.... After verifying the truth of the offer, Honey Singh is said to have set aside all his other commitments and rushed to Mumbai to meet Bhardwaj. At first when Honey Singh was contacted by Vishal Bhardwaj over telephone he considered it to be a prank call.[1] His belief consolidate when he was asked to rap on verses written by Gulzar.[1] After verifying the entire incident he set aside all his prior commitments and travelled to Mumbai to meet Bhardwaj at the earliest I'm not sure if a full-blown CCI is called for, though. I generally look for 5 examples of outstanding copyright issues to make sure it's worth asking for community resources. It can take hours for me to review fully - especially where close paraphrasing is the issue instead of copy-pasting. (Copy-pasting - so much easier!) I jumped heavily through his history and didn't find a lot of problematic content that seems to cross the line into copyright issues. What I did find seems to be gone. Mind you, this is a judgment call and I'm not 100% sure I'm suggesting the right one. Without actually DOING the CCI, I can't be sure I'm not missing something major. (talk) "

Madeline La Framboise I see you have edited the Madeline La Framboise article. I changed your edits because my sources, http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~gentner/indi/355.html#p3554, differ from your information.

You do not listen very well. It is you who they consider to be the Second Disruptor. And you appear blind to the fact that it is I who is now trying to Make Peace - because that is the Number One priority at Wikipedia. And you are not helpful at all in this. At this point, the only disruptor left is you, Lucas. And I'm trying to get you now to play ball by Wikipedia rules. You disappoint me once again by trivializing Politics this time (which is the exercise of Power). All this is Politics, and FT2 is watching everyone. And you are merely inflaming the situation now with these expressions of Your Political Opinions. It is time for you to find a way to make Peace with your Intellectual Enemies. And here, it is you now who, as Mel loves to say, is Spitting in Everyone's Soup. Why don't you ask Mel what that means. Mel, I know you are listening - can you explain to Lucas your latest metaphor? Or you, Banno, would you do it? I've not been able to memorize that acronymous Wiki link for it. Will one of you two Wiki Administrators come forth please at helping me explain to Lucas your Soup Metaphor?

Cleaned up a lot of the lists Too much stuff was being added to this article which only passively referenced the Ides of March. Bands mentioning it in their lyrics? People in film happening to die on March 15th? Used as a couple lines of dialogue in a tv show? These uses aren't notable. Unless the phrase IoM is integral to the work being referenced, it really should not be included in any lists here; doing otherwise would make all of the lists impossible to complete, as well as making the article unnecessarily lengthy.

Please excuse the intrusion, but I've noticed over the years that Petrarchan47 has come up with an enormous number of good ideas that never get acted upon. I'm wondering if a specific village pump page would be better for her proposals or if the gender gap project could help her structure her proposals so that they are more amenable to acceptance. I think it's a real shame that her ideas are just being ignored. I suspect the WMF could also benefit from her insight in many different ways.
New sock puppet/sock master issues. Ok im not sure whats going on but there is definately some sock puppetry going on here. It might be related to Brexx or Tremanshoe or both or a seperate sockpuppet issue but i believe there's a connection between the following users: made this edit which i reverted only for a new account to make a similar edit which i reverted and warned them about on for another new account to try and re-add the info with a source which i also reverted. Now my thoughts are that CiaraFan4Ever might be the sock master here or alternatively the other two accounts are linked to Brexx or Tremanshoe. Or maybe neither... it just seems suspicious.

" Midwest Airlines or Northwestern Mutual? I just swapped out the pic on the economy section for the Northwestern Mutual tower for a picture of a Midwest Airlines boeing in flight.

While Northwestern Mutual may be a fortune 500 company, it is not nearly as well known or synonymous with Milwaukee as Midwest Airlines. But of course facts and logic never seem to matter in ' world.

Actually, a lot of anthropologists would dispute that there are racial gaps in IQ, not least because (as people who actually study the subject of 'race', rather than just making generalisations about it), they are aware that 'race' is a complex social construct, rather that a simplistic biological 'fact'. Actually, I suspect many would argue that the same can be said for 'intelligence' too.

" Poor translation for The Boss ""Voyevoda (""Woman Warrior"")"", that is poor translation (either in the game or in the article, dunno what the game says on this). Voyevoda means War Leader or Warchief and in no way, shape or form does it imply anything about a Woman. A note should probably be made to clear it up, as it's either a poor traslation from Japaneese into Russian and subsequently English (in the game) or a mistake in wiki article. "

:SAT Game For Dummies A tag has been placed on SAT Game For Dummies, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add on the top of SAT Game For Dummies and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from independent reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.

All kaikolars are concubines of brahmins. It fucking disgusting. they were so desperate that atleast one woman from every family became a devadasi. then her children come back and marry into the kaikolar caste. This is the classic definition of concubinage. Moreover some kaikolar pice of whore is yapping that kaikolar are not isai vellala it seems. Go read the reference, isai vellala are kaikolar devadasis who then renamed themselves as isai vellala.
I just wanted folks to more know about actual real vampires. I just wanted folks to know more about actual real vampires not just the ones in Hollywood. For centuries real vampires have lived in secrecy and practice the faith in secret. The whole negative discussion as to why my articles should be deleted just validates and supports vampires living in secret and not sharing anything about our lifestyle or faith with the mundane public. (Thank God the rest of the world is a little more open minded and civil, than some of these disgruntled, bitter, Wikipedians. I find myself laughing at the bitterness and hostile tone of some of these people. They should put this kind of energy into finding a cure for AIDS or ending world hunger. It is amazing that so many obviously, disgruntled, unhappy people are on Wikipedia. I guess not a lot of happy go lucky out the coffin vampires like me are on Wikipedia. Maybe more people should take up the vampire faith. Although it might not help some of these severely depressed and repressed souls. Vampires just do not have the time or energy for this kind of negative energy. I feel really sorry for all those people who have nothing better to do besides sit around and discuss why someone does or does not have a right to post something on Wikipedia. It is really sad and precious time wasted on having a nasty attitude and a closed mind. These people make me thank my lucky stars I am a proud and very happy vampire. Many Blessings and Hope All those Unhappy Wikipedians find something positive to do with their time and energy. Vampire Libby Hodges
Mod Problem I see that on your user page you list pages/users blocked, articles edited, etc etc. Is this just a history of your stalking, trolling, and abusive bullshit? It seems to be that you're a loser who needs to brag that you troll Wiki and block users who try to make the site a better place. Most of your stuff is done in secret, but when somebody does expose you for being a trolling loser, you simply block them from even being able to talk on their own talk page. Guess what? A person's personal talk page is not yours for editing as it does NOT need to be factual. If it did, it would be the user's Facts page, not the Talk page. It's for Talking, which you as a troll clearly wouldn't want if that discussion revolved around you abusing your privileges as an admin. If the right people saw that they might take away those little jpg badges that you think are real and then your life would be worthless even to you, like it is to the rest of the world. It's good to know that you guys are immature, CHILDISH, irrelevant trolls with absolutely nothing resembling a real life.

Magashito, you try to promote a pseudo-historic fairy tale, which had no linguistic historic and genetic background. Do not try to interpret the opinion of real scholars (academic scholars university professors) as racism. Or did you forget the Armenian genocide (where turanism played a part) or Szlasi system (the turanism was also its core belief)? I think do you support uneducated self-appointed shaman scholars like Badiny or Zajti, who invented the parthian-Hungarianan Jesus tale. Badiny and Zajdi did not have any university degree in linguistic or history. So they were self-appointed shaman scholars. Zajti was just a librarian (not a serious job and degree). Technological development is part of the culture. But can we talk about central asian theatricals? Novels? Philosophers? ? Paintings, sculpture, and serious architecture? Or wat does culture means for you? Be serious, you try to defend a clown-like losing case, which lies discredited the Hungarian people in so many times in Europe.

" Liberal POV ""The package includes provisions for lowering import tariffs and agricultural subsidies, making it easier for developing countries to compete with the developed world in global markets."" This sentence has a clear economic liberal viewpoint. Who can guarantee these countries will really be more competitive?

Mctrain This talk of the article being a hoax is a lie. Someone placed Vitus' name into a fake article about Sacred Skull order and then everything that was also attached to vitus got destroyed believing that it was a hoax- it all went through the grinder- but that is bullshit- there is no hoax with anything attached to the vitus person except that his name was unfairly put into that bogus society article. Go to www.avoision.com and punch in what people said about him when he took on his title- those are the pople that looked to make trouble withthe guy on wikipdeia- now if anyone writes about any topic related to this guy they are labled as a hoaxer- but every peice of work I have written on is verifiable by the sources given and is truthful- Why should anyone put up with this constant accusation of hoaxing- there is no hoax, except for people placing the guy's name into a bogus Sacred Skull order article- why should eveything else be destroyed too- This is bullshit- and I'm sick and tired of that!!!!

My Dear Courcelles You might take a moment and let Mr. Sensei48 know that you monitor all my postings; needless to say, its superfluous for him to forward them to you. Im sorry to see youve misled this graduate of Notre Dame on the matter of my conduct or misconduct. Ive never denied that my record at Wiki is rich with demerits; both Custer and Reno (especially Reno) were masters of the demerit at West Point. No dishonor in that. My advice to Sensei48 is to form a skirmish line, and hold that position. Do not retreat to the timber. Neither should he order a charge to the rear: that way disaster lies. I include the rousing Notre Dame Victory March to help inspire you to defend your remarks of May 5, 2011: Rally sons of Notre Dame Sing her glory, and sound her fame Raise her Gold and Blue, And cheer with voices true, Rah! Rah! For Notre Dame. We will fight in every game Strong of heart and true to her name. We will ne'er forget her And we'll cheer her ever, Loyal to Notre Dame. Chorus: Cheer, cheer for Old Notre Dame Wake up the echoes cheering her name, Send the volley cheer on high, Shake down the thunder from the sky, What though the odds be great or small Old Notre Dame will win over all, While her loyal sons are marching Onward to Victory. Bon Courage!

" Kurds are not Iranian Kurdish people are not ""Iranians."" Just because there is a possiblity that the Medians were ancestors of the Kurds does not in any way make the Kurds ""Iranian."" Just because Kurdish is a bit similar to languages like Persian, does not make Kurds ""Iranian."" Kurdish people are descendants of many different people that inhabitated Kurdistan such as Hurrians, Gutians, Mittani, Cordune, and much more. Kurds are not ""Iranian people."" I have many many reliable scholarly sources on the Kurds, and it does not mention anything about being ""Iranian."" Kurds have their own histroy, and are a distinct people. The term Iranian, in itself is wrong to describe. Today, the term is used to describe a person who lives or is from Iran. Therefore, many people will be heavily confused when they see this term. Not only that, but like I said, Kurds are not Iranian in the first place. I have many sources to back it up and I don't know why Wikipedia allowed such false information to be posted up. I am not denying that the Kurdish lanugage can be described as a lanugage that is part of the Indo -European family of Northwestern Iraninan languages, but to say that the Kurds themselves are Iranian is completley false. Kurds have a long history in the Middle East and were even mentioned by the Sumerians. Kurds are descendants of many different people and there is not only historical evidence to back that up, but genetic evidence as well. Dont think so? Then go search for yourself."

Whether it looks professional or not is not for you to decide. I am following the Wikipedia guidelines. I belive you were the one (maybe it was Gwenol) who told me that the actual title of the article did NOT have to match the subject. A song title is a proper work of art and is capitalized by the artist in a particular way. There are no guidelines stating naming conventions within articles. If you still disagree, I think we should have a third party administrator address the issue, because I am definetely not breaking any Wikipedia rules.
Comment: Good job everyone! Prose has been brought down to a more manageable size and in quite a short time I must say. It's good to see the article has so many interested editors willing to help. Having said that, here are some suggestions for further improvement: The article still needs some work to fully comply with the Manual of Style. Per Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context#Dates stand alone years should not be linked. There are several instances of linked years in this article. Also per Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context words should only be linked if they provide appropriate context for the article. An example of this problem happens in the Economy section where common words such as aircraft, coffee and automobiles are linked. Per WP:DASH date ranges should not use hyphens but rather endashes. This seems to be a problem in citations. In the External links section there's no need to tag English sources as such; this is the English Wikipedia after all. Only tag sources in Portuguese. I have some more comments but no more time today. I'll get back on this tomorrow. Good luck,

" Hey asshole. Stop putting in the redundant phrase ""a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface. So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

You have no respect or common decency. You just want to remove anything that don't sound mediterranean appealing to you. While Im not racist I am anti turkish and yes I admit it. Look how much damage the turks have done to Bulgaria and also other Balkan nations. Millions perished during the occupation and many have fought for those nations to be independent. For you to not support an anti turkish person makes you a traitor. Maybe you are of turkish decsent? Also you want to filter out scientific facts that supports a theory that bulgarians are purely white european and not turkic and instead you support lies that say bulgarians are mediterranean and should be turk friendly. This is anti-white and anti-european.

Sorry for horning into your talk page, but I'm still drafting the remount service article and hope to do one on the remount concept as well. Early on the Army decided that it was cost-prohibitive to maintain whole herds, so they used the remount stations to house selected stallions and then contracted out with local horse breeders to provide mares. Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I), but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.

There are 34 references in Michael Aldrich - 17 are from the Archive, 4 are from reputable broadsheets, 3 are from peer reviewed publications, 4 are UK Government reports, 4 are books, 1 is a City government website and 1 is a University Art Gallery. The reverted edits fromOnline Shopping and Electronic Commerce which cover the four central claims have those references you quote. The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used. There are three central claims - he invented an online shopping system[he actually claims to have invented online shopping, which I left for peer review],Thomson Holidays 1981 was the first recorded B2B and Gateshead SIS/Tesco was the first B2C with the world's first recorded online shopper. For the first claim I found 4 sources in the Press Cuttings plus of course Aldrich's own claims. For the second there are also 4 sources, one peer reviewed. For the third, there is a peer reviewed source and a TV interview by Lawrence McGinty, an acclaimed UK science reporter, broadcast on Independent Television News in the UK in 1984. In looking at the sources common-sense is needed. Aldrich's teleshopping systems received a very sceptical welcome. HiFi systems were the big news in 1980. Many reports of his new system are wonderfully garbled and a little silly. Few understood what he was talking about. Online shopping did not exist. I experimented with a 14 year old, a fifteen year old and a 64 year old professor to test your objections to the references. Apart from tidying, they thought the references were more than adequate.

I find this insulting. Look up the wikipedia article White Americans, are there any mixed race people on that picture there? Could Obama ever be considered a ""white"" american? So how is it logical that a half Asian man can be considered an asian american? I have only one explanation for this, racism. If you have another explanation, please elucidate me. - "

Username merger Hello. I do not want to merge anything. I have had dozens of different usernames across the years, one at a time. When I change to a new username I never use the old one again. I never use two usernames at the same time, and honestly, I do not even know all my old usernames. I addition, I use to forget the old passwords too, so I can not log in with an old username either.

" Henrietta Van Laer says, ""Such a comment is clear proof that Wikipedia is NOT an encyclopedia. An encyclopedia is supposed to aim at detachment and balance, and to confine itself to facts. Now you are admitting that you are some sort of left-wing propagandist society. Wikipedia seems to be run by American left-wingers who have given up hope of ever getting power in the USA, so they retreat into a fantasy-world, a sort of cyber-reality from which most facts are excluded. Your own personal contributions above show that you are intervening to suppress anything anybody puts in about the Lib Dem party that is less than complimentary. You are just being dishonest."" "

You should look up the definition of vansalism that you quote. You will see that an honest attempt to improve an article by including true but controversial statements does not constitute vandalism. In fact your revert of my edit on strategy is far closer to vandalism. The coaching staff has made it painfully clear to even the casual observer that cheating is part of their strategy. As for the edit to the discussion of the Pat's article, isn't that the purpose of the discussion.

regarding the user GoodDay the user GoodDay is a troll, he keeps going around on peoples talk pages trying to stir up trouble for me (even though i hardly log on here anymore), this is what he does. he has no pupose in life, but to stalk certain users and try and stir up false rumours/trouble he has done it many times, note how he adds nothing to wikipedia, he just comes on here to argue. its obviously the highlight of his life. very sad. 86.10.119.131

" Why is it surprising that USGS calls it a gut? Sloughs are often guts. There is nothing in this article that indicates it is anything but a gut or slough, not an estuary. The friends may be a reliable source, who knows, I'm told that if 3 blogs say something in agreement it can be considered reliable information. If there are no reliable sources that say it's an estuary that information should be removed. I would tag it as inaccurate, but I am under threat of permanent community ban if I should question ""facts"" on Wikipedia in articles. It's your article, you want to call a slough an estuary, okay.

You revert this and you revert that and then do your research and realize your actions were premature and then have to stick with your accidents and stupidity and lie to the cops here subsequently blaming your stupid actions on me.

Iceland Some Icelandic IP keeps adding Iceland to the core definition, as if this was the widely accepted position. Iceland is not part of Scandinavia per the most common definition, and needs to be mentioned in the context of the extended usage only. Even though Iceland was largely (but not exclusively) populated by people from what became known as Scandinavia a millennium later, Iceland as a country is not part of Scandinavia, just like Australia is not part of England even though its population is mostly descended from English people and speaks English. What makes Scandinavia, a term that entered usage in the 18th and 19th centuries, a relevant entity, is the common (mutually intelligible) language, which Iceland is not part of.

Every article that I wrote is based on factual sourced material that can be checked for yourself-period. You explain to me why, articles based on factually sourced material should be destroyed, and you explain to me, why if someone takes another person's name and puts it into a BS article that what is truthful surrounding that person should also be destroyed- you explain to me the logic of that!

Concerning sources only from certain published astrologers and for Non-neutral point of view attitude in the traits area 1) Many areas of this article do not represent a worldwide point of view, do not forget that astrologers may differ in their interpretation. There are some legitimate sources from some Western-type astrologers like Goodman for example but these astrologers do not represent all the Worldwide astrological community. It would be better if there were additions from even more legititate astrologers from all over the world and not only from certain known Western ones 2) In the traits area there is clearly a tendency for Non-Npov attitude were only positive traits have added there in a overwhelming and exaggerating manner and almost no negative traits at all. Aquarius have negative traits too but it seems the editor that added the latest traits had picked only positive traits and did not added the negative ones for his personal reasons...

" Explaining my edits The article previously stated, ""Despite having no formal business background, a number of prominent Israeli and Jewish-American businessmen have visited Pinto for consultation ...."" I changed this sentence because, grammatically, the prior version implied that the businessmen had no formal business background, whereas it is Pinto who has no formal business background. I also changed the identification of Jacob Arabo (""Jacob the Jeweler"") from ""famed jeweler and convicted felon"" to just ""jeweler"", because the article about Arabo himself does not mention him as having been convicted of anything. Although the source cited for the sentence does refer to Arabo as being a convicted felon, that does not seem to be relevant enough to this article to mention here. (talk) "

" MLK incident It's true that Greenberg said what he said. It's true that a Chicago Sun Times blog reported what he said. Those two facts, in and of themselves, do not make the MLK incident ""relevant"" to his ESPN career. The fact that there was no meaningful followup coverage in reliable sources should establish that. Alleging that Greenberg's comment was a Freudian slip simply because he has mentioned making such slips requires a citation from a reputable source establishing that he said he makes Freudian slips. I'll assume good faith on the part of the IP editor who has been reinserting the MLK incident, but I strongly question the relevance of including what appears to be a simple spoonerism, even if it has racial connotations.

The popular belief itself is certainly encyclopaedia-like content regardless of its truth. For example we are quite sure now that Hera or Zeus are only myths but they have their place in an encyclopaedia. I think speaking about national catastophes we need only those that were really fatal blows not everything that went wrong in the course of our history. I think the traditional list is quite obvious: 1241, 1526, 1849, 1920, 1956. Luckily no present-day event has a similar magnitude, from some wider perspective they are only a strong storm, small riots etc. What the article really needs, I think, are literary sources mentioning the curse. I vaguely remember for example a Vrsmarty poem from the 1850s but I'm not sure.
Okay, I'll transfer this discussion to the article's talk page.

The CIA and the US goverment historically have admitted that mexicans are white when they do the census.I I am curious, the CIA fact book states that the USA is 81.7% white 12.9% black, 4.2% Asian, and 2% others? This adds up to about 100%, what happened to all the Mexicans, and Hispanics? Are they saying that ones a Mexican crosses over the border he or she becomes white? that makes no sense. At what percentage does a mestizo become white, 50%, 75%, or 90%. According to the U.S census if a Mexican marks Mexican on the U.S Census, he or she will be classified as white. This leads to my final question, shouldnt then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture, doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken. I agree with having a predominate 35-45%, if you look at the Aregentina demographics it states that 57% of the population has ameridian ancestory, but 85-97% of the population states that they are white? I am from Jalisco, I would have to say that most people I have seen look more white than Italians or Middle Easterns in the U.S.

" David Kane is the CEO of Kane Capital Management, a far cry from a serious university researcher. This is hardly the kind of person who does serious scientific research that get published in the Lancet. On ther other hand, a CEO is precisely the kind of person to have vested interests in the Iraq war. Further, what Kane has submitted is not even a ""study"". It is merely a comment, i.e. a minor issue. Also, ""submitted"" does not necessarily mean ""accepted"". Given Lancet's high standards, only a small fraction of submissions get accepted for publication. Even if this minor comment were to get published, the original authors of the Lancet casualty study can always clarify the soundness of their methodology. "
" Attitude towards Christians I have removed the opening sentence ""Tipu was widely reputed to be anti-Christian"". This is not found in the reference provided. Such a harsh, general statement as the opening sentence gives reader no further incentive to read the further paragraphs and is clearly a POV push.

Actually, the article clearly notes that the POV in question is from the PRC, and further notes clearly that the PRC does not actually control the island. Stating the PRC's POV when noting its source does not violate NPOV.

So, yes their army was probably Turkic speaking and even the language of the army was probably Turkic. But the language of culture was Persian and it was Persian culture that was spread in India by these Persianized Turks.

Semi-protected edit request on 25 January 2014 I'd like to edit the page because the genre section says they just play Heavy metal & Metalcore, even though they also play Thrash metal. Songs like Scream Aim Fire, Waking the Demon, Raising Hell, etc. are Thrash metal songs, so saying that they just play Heavy metal & Metalcore is incorrect. Also, some of the genres of the singles are incorrect, & I'd like to edit them too.

The flag currently shown in this article is incorrect. It was created by me based on a written description.

I previously uploaded an updated image of the correct design, but it seems to have vanished. Does anyone know why?

A tag has been placed on Auto Extreme(new)(2007), requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add on the top of the page and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable.

Brews, the rotating identical spheres makes a good action-reaction pair example. We'll begin with the general radial equation as it applies to sphere A, Applied centripetal force + induced centrifugal force = m were r is the radius. Since the string joining the spheres is not changing in length, then m will be equal to zero and so the centrifugal force outwards on sphere A will be equal to the centripetal force inwards on sphere A, which is given by tension T. Hence T = mv^2/r which equals both the centrifugal force and the centripetal force. Every force acting on sphere A will have an equal and opposite force acting on sphere B. Hence the centripetal force (-T) acting on sphere B could be considered as a reactive centrifugal force from the perspective of sphere A. This example is OK, but because it is circular, it masks the general picture. If you were to choose an elliptical example, that would eliminate some of the equalities and also eliminate any confusion that might ensue from those equalities. That's why I favour a more complicated example such as a Keplerian orbit.

In fact, he said it himself, the ""troops"" are NOT army, they are People's Armed Police. So how's a police force, which is again fully controlled & mobilized by a city, can impose a Martial Law?! "

Yeah 9 11 was carried out by 19 cave dwelling Muslims who are openly funded by CIA. Even the Iran Jundallaah terrorist leader admitted it. Let's see the Iran Contras affair, FBI Chiefs admitting the corruption as well as the DEA. They funded the same radical group OOsamaa ran with known as the Mujihadeeens, Hilary CLinton just admitted it in a interview. The retarded American troops are protecting poppy fields, they openly admit that, wow I wonder how drugs are getting into the country. Wikipedia is for fact suppressing fagots like yourself.

Note that there are many references to various primary source media inline and a handful of URL links, too. I am also particularly suspicious of this passage: In a 2002 Pew Research Center poll, 96% of white Americans claimed to have used the phrase in a ""playful manner"", and 94% had never previously considered the phrase to be an ethnic slur. However, 34% of Asian Americans believed it to be racist language.

"::P.S: A previous comment on this talk page gives a quotation worded identically to the first sentence of the article's history section as it stood at the time, and says ""This is a statement in Florian Cajori's history."" I initially took this to mean that the quotation was alleged to have appeared verbatim in that work of Cajori's. I now suspect that I was mistaken, and that it was merely intended to assert that something roughly synonymous appears in Cajori's history. At any rate, although Cajori does say, in the fifth edition of his history, that Hippolytus knew about casting out nines, he does not appear to have anywhere mentioned the expression ""abjectio novenaria"".

Timeline I saw your comment at RfE about the despute today at the Robert Watson article. ArbCom has extended their deadline to introduce new evidence relating to this particular dispute. I'd like to create a timeline of the incident so that ArbCom has a fair and accurate portrayal of what happened. So I've create a user page here. Can you please review this page and offer and guidance or feedback? Feel free to edit the page, too. Right now, I have (I hope!) a complete timeline of edits to the actual article. I plan expanding the evidence to include the talk page discussions, the RfEs, user page discussions, ANI, etc.. BTW, I notice that you help out a lot at our Help Desk. Would you happen to know how to put this evidence in a grid? I think it might be helpful to ArbCom if they could sort/filter the data on the fly. I know that this article has grid sorting, but not filtering. Thanks.

Read about your first literature work (half sanskrit,half telugu) http://www.organiser.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=Content&pa;=showpage&pid;=192&page;=19 If you don't know about proto dravidian languages fuck off...don't talk about origins of kannada. Kannada has no of telugu whatsoever,whereas telugu has some influence of kannada. This has been well documented and proven. Many scholars who know both kannada and telugu can tell you that.

I think this whole argument is irrelevant to the statement that is dubious. The sentence says the SSCS said that the O7A is part of their fleet. That part is true. However, what you guys are arguing about is the whether or not the statement is true. So basically, the tag is misplaced, as there is nothing untrue about the statement. Even if SSCS is lying, they did say the fact.

About crime in Transnistria Hi, what do you know about the crimes from region Transnistria?
I find reading and summarizing the generations pages quite painful - since they go on and on, but say so little. So if someone else wants to do some, they should go for it. I'm not sure merging the authors page with the book page is the best idea though - but I'm not especially familiar with the topic, was the whole theory developed in one book or over time? Would it be best to merge both and move it to something like Strauss and Howe's American generations?
I've never heard anyone connect 'Al Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001' with anti-semitism before. What on earth has 911 and Al-Qaeda got to do with some twisted incarnation of racism?

Taking Chopa as an example, in the Discography section the album information for each of their 3 albums is pretty much the same thing that can be found on each individual album's page. The albums are already linked to. So what I am suggesting is removing what is duplicative and migrating anything that does not appear for each individual album onto that respective album's article page. In the end, you would be left with a Discography section listing all 3 albums. I also noticed the Notes on selected pieces section; this section be taken out of the Chopa article and appear in the pages for all 3 albums containing only those notes relevant for that particular album. As it appears right now, the reader cannot tell where a song appears unless he/she scrolls up and searches. It would be more relevant to have the specific information pertaining to songs appearing on particular albums on the respective album's pages.

AC Transit used to serve most of the cities of the 680 corridor, but the cities basically kicked out AC Transit and now run their own services.

You clearly were reached to a online pal (who I've discovered writing two error ridden and skewed articles in as many days)-and are now doing their bidding rather than focusing on improving some rather poor content.

However, because the resignation has not yet been published in a reliable source, it qualifies as original research, which is not permitted on Wikipedia.

Given that you do have first hand knowledge of the situation, however, I'll leave it in with the ""citation needed"" tag for now and hopefully a source will be available soon (I'll look tomorrow). I feel comfortable with leaving the information for a few days with the citation tag while looking for a source, however, another editor could come along and justifiably remove it.

" Rename article, reorganize subcategories, and incorporate Jesus in Islam as a mainstream ""portrait"" The article's title is misleading. It leads us to believe it will be an article on historical (historicity) of Jesus. In fact, it is an article on Historical Portraits of Jesus, and should be named as such. Secondly, the subtitles need to be renamed/reorganized, and some material needs to be shifted into different categories. The entire ""cultural background"" subsection is Christian POV and should be named as such. Historical elements needs to be largely removed, since this article is about portraits, and some of the further subsections of that category are already covered in the Historicity of Jesus article, and are in fact duplicated there. And thirdly, and perhaps most glaringly from a secular POV, this article needs to incorporate Islamic portraits of Jesus (Isa Ibn Maryam ) This portrait needs to be a ""mainstream"" portrait. If this portrait is not included, then the article needs to be renamed Historical Christian portraits of Jesus These recommendations would be a good start in establishing the NPOV of this article "

In the language area the FYROM language is called <>. UNBELIEVABLE LIE !!! This is f*cking unbelievable. Greece has never recognised the FYROM language as <>. Not even all countries in the world has recognised FYROM as <> to start with. This is a provokation for most of us Greeks and a HUGE HISTORICAL LIE to write that minorities in north Greece speak <>(meaning the FYROM language) especially in a Greece related article !! The citizens of FYROM have no historical connection with Ancient Makedonia and with Alexander the Great. THEY ARE LIARS !!! In the below links you will find some details of why we Greeks we will never recognise these Slavic falsifiers as <> http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/2009/02/09/an-essay-about-macedonia/ http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/2009/02/11/the-greeks-of-macedonia-in-slavic-sources/ http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/2008/09/10/pseudomacedonians-the-fallacy-of-their-cause-by-vasil-gligorov/ http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/2008/09/10/a-thesis-on-fyromian-denial-syndrom/ Also when i try to edit it some administrator\administrators start to make the usual threats that they will block my account for messing with their Pseudomakedonian language...They love having this LIE in the Greek wikipedia page i guess grrrrrrrrr
" etymology The family consists of the genus Aplodactylus. The name means either ""single finger"" or ""simple finger"" (Greek haploos / aploe + daktylos). [Sourced to Fishbase, depending on whether you look at Aplodactylidae or Aplodactylus-punctatus] Is anybody able to look at Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1832? This is supposed to be the original source of the genus name, and conceivably gives some insight as to where the name was meant to come from. (Primary sources aren't ideal, but a self-contradictory secondary source isn't better.) Presumably there is some defining and identifying property of the fish's fin, which not only gives it the name but would more broadly also be worth mentioning in the article. "
I had not seen that actually. This user is really a curious case, not sure what the user's angle is. I think we may have actually declined the same CSDs, and I'm assuming it was accidental that you reverted my other changes to the pages as well? . Otherwise, I'm not sure why you'd remove a reference I added and reinstate an unsourced section about a person's penis.

" The problem is with ""balance"" in the Reception section. Historians hate the series because it skews perception of the war. There is no mention of this at all in the article as it stood before my edit. The fact that this is a featured article, on Remembrance Day, is further proof of how much Blackadder has pushed into the public consciousness as a viable telling of the story of the First World War! The article as you would have it is one of a universally acclaimed television show, which is not the case at all.

You have a definite conflict of interest in this situation. Your from Calgary, Harper's home base. You shouldn't have permission at all to edit or oversee his account. I will be lodging a complaint with wikipedia.
The previous format of the page provides a better insight into the problem, you haven't explained yet why the categorisation of the different uses of the term is necessarily something bad. The POV/nationalist fights have nothing to do with the format of the article, they'll continue in this format, as well. You have erased half the entries on top of it - the ones from the geographical section.

Hello, Ceoil. Thanks for this and the note on my talk page. It's not a huge issue and I'm not going to make a drama out of it. But the bit about being impatient with Dorothy strikes me as distinctly odd. Sure I've never seen that before and I question whether there can be any real sources for it. I don't really see why the article should valorise so yet another oddball theory about Lucy, especially as the Bateson 'incest' one is so much more plausible and yet not referenced. But as I say it's years since I did any Wordsworth reading. Of course critics have always tended to agree the Lucy poems were influenced by the intensity of William and Dorothy's relationship. I see Wordsworth is actually underrepresented on Wikipedia. His sonnets are hardly mentioned (just the one poor article I can see). I might do a few articles if I can get hold of Moorman from somewhere. Another lifetime perhaps ;)?
I agree, she shouldn't be labeled an incumbent. You can't run for First Lady. Thanks for helping address the issue. I think that I may actually be bold and remove it, just to see what people say, or if they notice it at all. I was hoping to get more of a discussion. I would also like to point out that I am not trying to downplay the first ladies role to her country. I just think that an incumbent is only an elected person, or appointed like in the Sec. of State. Photo redux OK, now we have yet another new photo - the one of Michelle waving on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. I like it, think it is a good photo - and until we have an official portrait I'd go with this one. But rather than repeatedly changing the picture can we discuss here from now on and try to come to consensus on any alternatives? I also corrected the caption field so that a caption will appear. /talk As I said before, the photo is a good one of Michelle, but it needs to be cropped. The man in the background needs to go. Cite request I have asked for a cite for her membership in UCC. Please supply one to remove the tag. Requesting a citation is not a disruption, but a logical use of WP policy. If I had found a cite like I had for Obama, I would have changed it to Christian, but I can't, so I have left it and requested the citation.

" I was surprised and confused. It turns out his name is often written by """". But this letter is not in the Slovak alphabet (Slovak language). I'm also no expert on the Slovak language, and therefore can not advise you to rename the article. I just write in the Russian Wikipedia article about figure skating, and, as we are all the names in the transcription of Cyrillic, it is fundamentally important to us to write in their native language person. Maybe """" really came into his name from the Hungarian, but he was born in Bratislava, Slovakia, and is some information about his ties with Hungary we do not. Moreover, in the Hungarian no letter """" ). In the Russian Wikipedia, we take the official spelling, that is, we would have taken the name of a Slovak skating assotsiation. But you may have other rules. I really thought it was a mistake, but now I do not know. Sincerely, "
I fantasize about seeing my girlfriend with another man. I want to blindfold her, tie her r to a bed, fuck her for a bit, then have someone take my place. I don't want her to know I'm doing it, and I don't want her to know who she fucked. The girl has cheated on me quite a bit, which hurt, so I know that ultimately, this fantasy is about showing her that she is my property. I will do with her as I please, and give her to whom ever I feel she deserves to be given to.

WP:RUBBISH says arguments to avoid include ""Surmountable problem .... the basis of the quality of the current article."" WP:CRYSTAL adds, ""It is not appropriate for an editor to insert their own opinions"" ""about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects"", which seems to apply too. What specific policy indicates that your speculation about future disruption, or your belief of present disruption, is a valid deletion argument?

" I see what you're saying about the sources and all, but it still seems like it's somewhat arbitrary what they will consider to be ""enough"" reliable sources. All in all, the mass nominations have kinda taken the wind out of my sails; I was hoping to create a slew of articles on seduction-related subjects but it seems not worth the effort if it can all be destroyed via deletion at the whim of whoever shows up to AfD. I think there is a systemic bias going on here, and the system has created the means by which people's personal opinions can affect what Wikipedia covers and what it doesn't. If we got rid of the notability requirement and just allowed all verifiable content to stay here, then it would create a much more objective system and we wouldn't have all these problems. Having said that, I'm well-aware of the unlikelihood of that happening and am basically waving the white flag at this point. "

" Other asians like phillipinos score significantly less (around 90). It is difficult to explain how the environment, racial bias, etc. could explain these consistent differences which show up all across the world. Rushton continues this line and says that there are other traits which differ between groups. He dichotimizes it into 3 races to make a point. He could as easily done it with 4, 5, 6 , 7 or infinite races. As humans we need to categorize things because that is the only way we can make sense of the world. Technically every organism in the world could in theory be it's own ""race"" since everyone differs slightly from the next. No two creatures are exactly alike (for the most part). Putting things into categories is arbitrary because every living thing is related to each other by differing degrees. Fish, birds, mammals etc. all had a common ancestor and are all related to each other by varying degrees. It is only in the human mind that there are clear demarcations between anything. However, in the real world these differences are meaningful to us and categorization is necessary."

" Thanks. From my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts: One parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population. The difference is: the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ""race"" (whatever ""race"" might be), the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ""ethnicity"". A second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history (example: the holocaust - not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process).

The Wall Street Journal article today explains, that yes, Bergwall has convictions for earlier crimes, but that the eight murders convictions he was convicted of have been quashed. The article made no mention of the earlier convictions that were less serious offences than murder, and said that Sture Bergvall is a convicted Swedish criminal in the lead. The article is very wordy, and yet unclear.

I wonder what your qualifications on military history acctually are? You appear to be 'revising for exams' so not that high seemingly. Never mind, perhaps your historical knowledge stretches as far as knowing what a 'little hitler' is. As for 'community consensus' it dosnt bother me if 1000000 people think the continental blockade and system are the same thing - they - like you on so many issues are wrong, i cant really help that can i? It only remains for me to advise you to fuck off and die like the scum you are and i hope your family and friends are all blown away in a freak accident. bigger man thing failed. shit. un merge the two for the love of accuracy if nothing else. Enjoy your wikipedia king status - i expect it will be the best paid position you ever amount to D

Mass Murder TAB Che Guevara was a mass murderer. He killed hundreds with his own hand. His ideology, the communism, murdered nearly 100million people and ruined the life of billions. Your idol is this communist pig. I won't stop while we both are living.

mtDNA L If you misrepresent a genetic study again (and you have repeatedly done so) you will be reported for vandalism. Brisighelli et al. 2012: Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes of African origin are mainly represented by haplogroups M1 (0.3%), U6 (0.8%) and L (1.2%) that is: L (1.2%) not 9.2% as you have constantly claimed and reverted.

" I do not see how it is relevant if sources use the word famous. We are never obliged to use the same words as any source. You can find a source claiming that almost anything is famous - it's hardly a rare case where lots of sources do so - so should we describe everything as famous? No, I tried that and it was rightly shot down. You can find a source - a famous one! - which says that this opera is a shabby little shocker. And those words aren't even listed as ones to avoid, so do we use them as if they are objectively true? Obviously not. I don't believe the word is forbidden on Wikipedia, I already said that. But we have a guideline called ""words to avoid"". It doesn't say ""avoid these words, unless you really want to use them"", it doesn't say ""avoid these words unless you see them in external sources"", it says ""avoid these words, because they neither impart nor summarise verifiable information"". The guideline is very long established, and I see no sensible case for an exception here. 200.83.101.199 "
Nationality I understand that he was a Arab/Palestinian Nationalist but he born, raised and educated in Egypt and fought for the Egyptian Army/Muslim Brotherhood (Egyptian) not the Palestinian fighters, would it not be more accurate to describe him as Egyptian?
Word length is a better measure of brevity. A lead section should not get bogged down trying to be too descriptive, too prescriptive or critiquing its conventional definition. You could just say: Capitalism generally refers to an economic and social system in which the means of production are predominantly privately-owned and operated for profit. Investment, distribution, income, production, pricing and other economic activity are usually determined by the owners of these means of production according to their own self-interest. Almost all countries in the world have adopted elements of capitalism in their economic systems.

Vandal Dear WP Sysop CambridgeBayWeather, , an ordained teacher of the Hamsa Yoga Sangh cult has been creating havoc for the past weeks by relentlessly inserting the name of his guru, his guru's book, quotes from his guru's book, and external link to their website on the following articles Kriya yoga, Mahavatar Babaji, Nath, and Adi Nath when the majority of the editors (actually all of them) who are experts on the subject agree that his guru is illegitimate, his inserts does not enrich (add anything substantial) the already existing articles, and only aims to promore the personal interest of their organization. This wants to turn WP into a propaganda material for a highly questionable (possibly harmful) pseudo-Hindu cult while pretending to be an impartial concerned Wikipedian who only wants to enrich it. The situation is really bad. He has just been banned but as soon as he gets unbanned he begins to relentlessly vandalize the pages with irrelevant and immaterial cult propaganda once again. It is futile to try and protect the integrity of an article when someone like this person , like the Energizer Bunny, keeps on reverting them and gets away with it without being taught a lesson. To see for yourself that Hamsacharya dan is really an ordained teacher of the cult he keeps on inserting to the articles and not just a concerned Wikipedian with no alterior motive, please see the following website [List of Authorized Teachers] and scroll down a bit for Hamsacharya Dan Kogan. Please help us. Will you help us? Thanking you in advance,

The Sims 3 expansion and stuff packs listing together? Since the Good Article review suggested that The Sims 3 expansion packs and stuff packs be on its own listing, my question is this, if we decide to split The Sims 3 games, i.e. core game with expansion and stuff packs, onto one listing, should we remove The Sims 3: Stuff Packs article and merge it into a new article with core / expansion pack / stuff pack article listing? I think the core / expansion pack / stuff pack article is wise, and thus, eliminating the stuff pack article (in my honest opinion) because we don't need two lists of stuff packs. So, this is a public vote! (and note the good article review is in the Archive 3 article page; see archive list above for link). Sundogs talk page sandbox

False interpretation of references and unnecessary ing I've noticed that some editors are inserting text not justified by the reference given. An example Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Politics marks clearly Ustashe as a terrorist organization, not as far-right as it was suggested in the earlier text version. Also, no need to add 'fact' i.e. everywhere. After reading the text and some references (Der kroatische Ustascha-Staat, for example) I see that the fact-ed text is already supported by the given reference. If someone finds it useful to point at a specific page or quote text from a given reference - it's ok. It is highly uncooperative marking text as not sourced without reading already given references.72.75.20.29

I think part of Wikipedia is defining what a term means, many words are used in many different ways. I remember 'ethnic group' being a pretty vague term before Wikipedia was around. Everyone uses the word 'evolution' in a different way. I don't believe in 'correct' definitions so much as consistent and useful ones. I propose we adopt the following: Evolution: Umbrella term, any change over time, as stated in first sentence of article. Natural selection, horizontal gene transfer, etc... Mechanisms which explain evolution, the observation. Theories of evolution: A theory to explain one particular facet of evolution in terms of natural history (e.g. Out of Africa Theory, CretaceousPaleogene extinction event) The other problem with this article is that many scientists were motivated by a desire to explain why livings things are adapted to their environment or to explain the diversity of life. As opposed to Evolution per se The Precambrian rabbit wouldn't falsify Evolution so much as discredit all of our current theories about Evolution. What do we think?

split out Preston City Historic District By the map in the newly-available-online NRHP doc for the HD, it seems to me that the HD is included in, but is substantially not the same as the village. Since the village is asserted to be the town center, and since the Town Hall is included in the village but not the HD by my reading, it seems there's stuff to say about the village not relevant for the HD and vice versa. I am choosing to develop a DYK-length NRHP HD article at Preston City Historic District, consistent with an agreement in a long discussion about similar NRHP HDs that some editors watching here will be familiar with. I believe i'll be able to use some HABS photos to illustrate the article.

Be careful with excessive External links. Make sure that they really belong there before adding them. It may be best to use the links as citations. Just make sure that they are Reliable sources.

I don't understand the significance of link number 8 above. It is supposedly the article when it was merged. But the merge itself is a change from what it used to be. It makes no sense to ask for an opinion as to whether your latest edit is better than it was after you first merged the article. Neither version represents anyone's real input. Also, I can't find in the revision history, the first paragraph I remember seeing in the Virgin birth (mythology) article. According to some versions, both articles began with a paragraph about the hero. This is not how I remember it. The first paragraph of Virgin birth (mythology), about 'the statement that because mythological births were not virgin births they have no relation to the Christian story' (not the exact words) was already in the first paragraph of the unfinished Virgin birth (mythology). The finished wording may be awkward, but it is only because I try to keep material that others contributed, rather than delete it. However, the original paragraph avoided mentioning that there are sources which show a long-standing tradition of comparison, and the strict definition of a virgin birth has been no hindrance to this tradition. In the past, the virgin birth part hasn't shut down the whole comparison, as was attempted in the original material of Virgin birth (mythology).
" Antony and the Johnsons Well, Cardinal, is ""Antony's voice seems to channel Nina Simone and Bryan Ferry, and he has many celebrity admirers such as Philip Glass, Marc Almond, Lou Reed and the guest vocalists on I Am a Bird Now, Boy George, Rufus Wainwright and Devendra Banhart"" an opinion? Yes, of course it is. But people like you won't admit anything to the contrary. The noise is reminiscent of Nina and Bryan and has admirers, is all that is allowed. They can say it's a lovely noise. No one else is allowed to say it's not. Explain the rationale behind your thinking. Or do you think at all? Go and listen to the rubbish. Cringeworthy, it is."
Where is the blocking master when you need him? This is certainly not a polite comment sir. You should be blocked for attacking Mr Tombe.

" I saw the latter, of course. It wasn't directly aimed at you, but I didn't like it, either. Um.. you know what a diff is, do you? Just in case: You can get one by looking at the history of any page, selecting two versions, and then pressing the ""Compare selected versions"" button. You can include it by putting the complete link (with http:// etc) into single brackets like this: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/example_diff], the result will then appear like this, or like this. Look at the markup, you'll figure out the rest. These diffs or differences are often used as proof of precisely which edit by another user you are talking about. That's one beautiful thing about a wiki: It doesn't forget anything, which means that people have to think before they press ""Save page"". Alright, enough explained. Again, can you provide any diffs? Regarding truth, you may want to take a look at WP:A (especially this section, by the way). You see, Wikipedia has a set of guidelines and policies. Attribution, not truth, is the aim. I certainly appreciate that you care about Wikipedia like most of us do, but it's all about working together, not against each other. I'm sure that if you come up with serious doubts as to the accuracy/appropriateness of the way the book is quoted, others will listen. KNcyu38 (talk contribs) "

So are you the clever dick or rather arsehole that posts messages to me telling me my edit has been reverted? What do you know about durban? read about it at my south africa sucks I posted the following The minority white population still provide the majority of revenue to the city copuncil because of the punitively high taxes imposed on white owned properties. The lazy blacks still pay nothing yet call for more free handouts This is 100% true. The white community is taxed at rates that would make people in londons eyes water. Ask me. my tax on my home in uk is half of that imposed on my tiny house in durban. The blacks are paracites because they take and dont pay anything just take take and complain. This is un PC maybe racist to some ears but its the truth. So wiki is becoming a tool of propoganda by the afronazi marxist anc run government of south africa. Be brave and let the truth be told.

" Certainly. On http://www.david-strathairn.com/media/film3.html there are several WMV files taken from HBO specials. Those belong to and are copyright from HBO, and I see no ""used by permission"" there. I see a note that says ""No copyright infringements intended."", but that doesn't say that it's NOT a copyright infringement - just becaus ethey say they didn't mean to doesn't mean it didn't happen. On the same page there are also copies of featurettes from commercially available DVDs. These, too, will be copyrighted. One http://www.david-strathairn.com/media/tv3.html we have whole scenes taken from the HBO show ""The Sopranos"" - those are copyright HBO, too and again, I don't see a ""used with permission"" anywhere. On http://www.david-strathairn.com/media/radio.html there are all sorts of excerpts from radio shows, which are owned by the respective stations. I see no permission given there either. There is not doubt that all of these clips are copyrighted by the original owners. there is no evidence that they are posted with the owner's permission. Therefore this it is a reasonable conclusion that this is a copyright violation, barring evidence to the contrary. | Talk "
:Making Music History A tag has been placed on Making Music History, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read the general criteria for speedy deletion, particularly item 11, as well as the guidelines on spam. If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add on the top of the article and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any citations from reliable sources to ensure that the article will be verifiable.

Lehoiberri , it has come to my attention that you had expressed concern over my article, 'Hispanic (Updated)'. You state that much of my article is contained in the other article, 'Hispanic', and should be considered for deletion. The 'Hispanic' piece is not entirely accurate. The author of 'Hispanic' makes statements which are highly untrue and he doesn't take into account a certain segment of the Spanish-speaking population that shouldn't be included in his definition of hispanic. I am appalled and insulted by his misuse of the term. In the past, I tried to edit his article but he ended up reverting it back to his original. In frustration, I had no choice but to offer a correction to his article so others of my background can be assured of accuracy. I want you to respect my space. I ask that you respect my work as you would expect me and others to respect yours. Nothing is more irritating than seeing people write untruths and then not being able to do anything about it. All I ask is that you respect my work, my perspective, and my people's background. I'm not asking for much. All I'm asking for is for you to respect me and my work. Hopefully, you understand where I stand. Thank you. .
" Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights. This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue. Jones had only won a ""vacant interim"" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder. Re-read the fucking link; http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:12432 My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand. HBO are a joke....whenever Jones faced his hand picked opponents defending his bogus belts on their broadcasts, hbo would even mention the legit champion - Michalczewski."

" Are you fing kidding me? There are 30+ reliable sources listed in the pre-vandalism history of the page. This debate in this talk page has no importance and will not receive justice. I am making my objections public for the sake of posterity alone. If you want to see the sources: Go look at the history of the page pre-vandalism. Go look at the history of the talk page pre-vandalism. Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30+ sources are extensively discussed and analyzed, and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of ""reliable"" which you have not familiarized yourself with. This debate has already been done and it's very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs; the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page. Without an ""admin in my pocket"" my claims fall on deaf ears; I understand this all too well. If you or your allies were interested in due process, you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated.

" deleted part . - - Amy, welcome to Wikipedia. I just wanted to offer you a tip a user a few minutes ago typed some random letters to create an article called ""retail bank"". You erased those letters. I just wanted to thank you for being attentive and catching that blanking the letters, though, leaves us with a 0 byte article that won't show up as a red link. Normally, if someone creates an article full of gibberish like that (or crude/rude vandalism), it should have the following tag added to it: {{speedy}}. That tags the article for deletion so that an admin can come through and delete it from the database (as I did with retail bank). I just figured I'd let you know for next time, since you're already helping catch that kind of thing. -) Thanks again for keeping an eye out, and welcome to Wikipedia.

" WTF do you want from me? There are (Christian) folks who think they hold the monopoly on issues such as god, morals, and Christendom as such. And there are (Jewish) folks who will do everything to control issues such as Judaism, Israel, Palestine, and parts of ancient history. The latter are called the ""jew crew"" on fora that I have been on and I don't know or care whether that targets all Jews or all Israelis or who may feel offended by that. I did not invent the term nor do or will I give it a second thought. I, for one, am offended by religious fanaticism and nationalism (which both are reasons to present Jerusalem as the undisputed capital of Israel), and by folks who present biblical tales as accurate history (and derive political claims from that).

You wouldn't be referring to the agreement of rouble transfer that Vhi signed before Laar's PMship? The one that the State Comptroller's Office condemned as irresponsible and unlawful? Nope illegal agreements can't be considered as sufficient basis for giveaway of billions of roubles. It might have made a heck of a bribe to the then-reigning Soviet authorities, sure. As for the SUR->EEK exchange, nobody was forced to exchange their cash. I retained a few of my hard-earned rouble banknotes as memorabilia myself. (There's no need to remind you that they lost all financial value in a few short years.) It just so happened that BoE's rate was among the best available rates, and while SUR kept falling, EEK managed to brake the inflation down to a manageable level. Remember: events from this era are generally poorly understood by the general public. A lot of rumours circulated, some better, some worse. Some of these rumours were politically motivated. It was an era so hectic there was even no Internet! Taking a random thing you read or hear about anything from the early 1990s Estonia is likely to mislead you. !
" I am really disappointed with the dictatorship you Wikipedia administrators carry out. In your particular case, you still want to imagine you are living in the Meiji era.

I can't understand how Wikipedia can let a soldier, a brutish animal without intelligence, closer to the neanderthal than to the homo sapiens, have more authority editing articles than an expert in the subject. And you Americans are clearly the most retarded people on Earth. Now I see why Americans in Japan can only get the ugliest and most retarded women out there.

992 AD Map of Poland (in center) showing some of Silesia, Wroclaw/Breslau already conquered by Poland). Poland on and off conquered additional people's land surrounding Poland. In 1157 the Holy Roman Empire ended the Polish conquest of Silesia, by installing two Silesian duchies Wroclaw/Breslau and Ratibor (later named Lower Silesia and Upper Silesia. The empire installed Boleslaus and Mieszko as dukes of Silesia, who held both duchies in fief from the empire. Even the Duchy of Poland, the Polish dukes pledged allegiance to the empire and held territory as fief. Only in 1025 did Boleslaw I Chrobry declare himself king and died the same year. His son tried to evade taking the land in lien from the Holy Roman Empire, but after some years, had to submit. Further Polish dukes all submitted to the empire. Then Wenzel II, a king of Bohemia (part of the empire) also became King of Poland. Silesia, conquered in the 990s by Boleslaw I Chrobry was until 1157 ruled by Polish dukes (who were subject to the Holy Roman Empire). Thus Silesia, conquered in the 990s by Boleslaw I Chrobry was until 1157 'Polish'. Map of Poland in 992 AD (with Wroclaw - Silesia partially conquered) From 1157 Silesian dukes governed Silesia and they were subject to the highest dukes (magnus dux) of Silesia, the Holy Roman Emperors.

" Thanks Thanks for the barnstar. I love trivia pages - they're fun. But sometimes they oversimplify things, so that's why I put the wikilinks in, so people can find more information on the topics. RinkWorks is a fun site for trivia and humour of that kind. I also have some trivia files I collected a few years ago - I'm not sure where I got most of it from and I'm not sure how accurate some of the files are (with the exception of scrabble trivia), but they're fun to read. If you want them just give me a shout by e-mail and I'll send them as attachments. ''''''87 "

" Archont Petar and Petar Gojnikovi are two different people. Archont Petar was born in ca. 930. Petar Gojnikovi was born much earlier. Read this line from the House of Vlastimirovi article: ""Knez Petar Gojnikovi (son of Gojnik, grandson of Vlastimir), born ca. 870, ruled 892/3-917/8, captured by Bulgarians, died in captivity. "" Those dates are nowhere close to of Archont Petar's. All I know for a fact is that Archont Petar died either during or after the 970s. So, please, don't put false facts in an article unless you do some research. Also, Archont Petar is also called Predimir and in some sources, I am finding the use of Predimir rather than Petar for Archont Petar. This should help. "

" Edits to The College of Saint Mary Magdalen This edit on 7 January 2012 removed some documented, sourced material from the article. It is unusual for an editor to delete sourced material without consensus from other editors, and this edit draws attention because the deleted material relates to an unflattering aspect of part of the College's history. Further complicating matters, the edits have been made by user accounts Gaharne and Geoanthharne. These names are similar to the name of the College's current president, George Harne, so I should mention Wikipedia's policy regarding potential conflicts of interest, for any users not familiar with it. It states that conflict-of-interest editing ""is strongly discouraged"", but editors with potential conflicts are encouraged to disclose their interests on the article's Talk page, and discuss concerns about the article there. To restore the deletion of the material, I have performed an undo on that edit. "

" And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct. Niggardly It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the ""controversial"" word ""niggardly"", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination. What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments. I must of hit a nerve with some ""idiots"" who don't have a large understanding of the English language and it proper usage. LOL!"

Jtkiefer even warned Imdaking on his own page that he would be sockpuppeting if he continued to use both identities. My tagging of Jtkiefer's page was in good faith, because he/she reverted my tag, KNOWING the user was sockpuppeting how could I not assume it was the same person?

" Nope. This content edit to the article was not merely ""aggressive biased editing"", it was in fact nothing short of POV-driven vandalism. Sarah777, when making that edit, clearly knew she was falsifying the contents of the page. She knew that the term ""B.I."" in fact does include Ireland, in the usage of the English-speaking world at large, and that this meaning is the topic of that article. Of course, she doesn't want the world to be that way, but she know that it actually is that way. Changing an article in order to make it conform to the way you want the world to be rather than to the way you know the world actually is, is vandalism, period. This together with on the associated talk page, which clearly is biased, aggressive rhetoric. "

Since multiple editors have corrected you on this point and there is consensus for the link and the material, I going to ask you to stop commenting on this subject. In the meantime, please review WP:IDHT to understand why you have now breached the boundary between constructive editing and disruption which is blockable.

A simple review of the crap I get warned for by you is mroe than enough to tell me you have some bigger issue with me. So, piss off and ban me if you must. Ooops...was I being uncivil? And how big of a spiteful loser do you need to be to go back and look at the history of my talk page? Again, piss off and ban me if you must.

Kathryn Bigelow is a patriot who makes great war films. She set out to make an action film about the hunt for Bin Laden years ago. Then President Obama made a tough call and got the guy. Now the right wing propaganda machine seeks to negate the boost to Obama's image by making a political football out of Bigelow's film. This year has seen a huge, funded effort by the Super PAC propagandists to spread propaganda through social media and this article, not to mention the OPSEC fraudsters is a great example of that. Leave Kitty B's patriotic film alone, you flaming assholes!

You did not answer my question AGAIN. QUESTIONS: Why I am blocked? Why are others not blocked, if your policy forbids threats and personal attacks in emails? That's what was done to me, with no sanction, except to me. Why I am singled-out? Are these your buddies? I'd bet they are. All I get is roundabout answers from you people. How do you could determine what they sent you (supposedly sent by me to them) is even legitimate. I could forward a bunch of words to you that I wrote myself and claim they came from anybody. Fool.

"The title refers to remarks Hickey had repeatedly made on prior visits to Harry's bar about his wife having a fling with the ice man while he was on the road. This is mentioned several times in the play. I have wondered if any double entendre with the word ""come"" was intended which would certainly not be surprising among the characters of this play, although nothing of that kind is even hinted at in the dialog and if so that, even as just a title, it passed without comment in 1946. (Then again in 1938 the Cole Porter song My Heart Belongs to Daddy seems to make a subtle reference to cunnilingus (.. to dine on my fine finnan haddie .. asking for more .. etc) without any adverse results.) There is harsh irony in this since it appears that the opposite is the case, that Hickey's wife was totally faithful and endlessly forgiving of his womanizing and drinking sprees. This surfeit of virtue creates such self-hatred in Hickey and anger at his wife that he is ultimately driven to kill her to end their common pipe dream that each of his indiscretions will be the last.

" Corrected spelling of ""recognised"" to ""recognized"" in the Pluto article. I undid your revisions to the article, as your spelling is incorrect according to both Merriam-Webster's dictionary and my computer's standard spell-checker. Wikipedia was founded by Americans, and is hosted on servers in America. Pluto was discovered by an American, and its named approved by Americans. So you and your retarded-ass Asperger self can shut up and go cry in a corner about how your country sucks ass compared to America. Leave your goddamn piece of shit British spellings where they belong: in the toilet where America rightly put them."
" Just because something hasn't attracted criticism doesn't mean it can't be improved on. YLee's edit makes the summary more focused and fluent. I do find one problem with itthe reduction of the special effects passage. This now reads in its entirety: ""Douglas Trumbull and his effects team were given carte blanche to meet the December 1979 release date."" Though not inaccurate as a discrete fact, this rather misrepresents the history of the film's special effects work. While some reference to the previous work should be restored, I'd also argue for recasting the sentence to eliminate ""the December 1979 release date."" The beginning of the very next paragraph states that the film was ""[r]eleased in North America on December 7, 1979."" This sort of close repetition should be avoided, especially in the lead summary. The one other point I could see as significant enough to restoresomewhat abbreviatedis this: ""The film came together only days before the premiere; Wise always felt that the theatrical version was a rough cut of the film he wanted to make."" (As a minor point, ""tightened and new scenes"" is a bit awkward; in this case, the previous phrasing""tightened and added scenes""is better and still works grammatically in the sentence's new structure.)

" Trump's ethnic cleansing George Will, notable Conservative pundit, is the one whose view is that Donald Trump has proposed ethnic cleansing. I would never myself express an opinion in an encylopedia article. I merely voted that we add Will's highly notable opinion. This is in reference to his deportation plan of over 20 million Mexican-Americans, over half of whom were born here. Considering the amount of force one would require to deport 20 million human beings (hint:the military would most certainly be required), Will is by no means wrong or expressing an idiosyncratic view in accusing Trump of advocating ethnic cleansing, or a forcible homogenization of the population. Ethnic cleansing need not imply that Trump has promised to kill anyone, only that he has promised to ""make America more ethnically homogenous again"", by force. Have a pleasant day. "

I noticed that someone changed the release date to June 5, which isn't actually correct. The album is out now and was released on May 21st. It is on the shelves in music shops right now. I think the limited edition might have been delayed, but that's not the same as the release date changing. Alternatively, the release date might be different for different countries, in which case that would need to be stated, but I figure it's best to put the earliest release date for now.

The thing about it is, I can actually respect the concept she's trying to forward. I would have loved to be able to call on the Devil May Cry task force to comment on my RFA, but per the current canvassing rules I was unable to do so. I love the idea of asking people who've interacted with the user to comment, especially since it would allow us to better judge the user's merits. However I don't think it's going to happen, not the way Kelly is doing it. I'd probably support any proposals she made on the subject, argument or no argument. It wouldn't factor into my assessment of what the policy could do to help the project. Cheers, Lankybugger Yell

" PBS - The falklands were absolutely an example of ""occupied territory"" post-invasion. Note, the falklands aren't an entire country or even a significant portion of a country. This fact in my mind makes them simply ""occupied territories"". Shuki - Thanks for the ""understanding"". It's nice to see we can agree on something. Now that we are on the same side of the argument, let me ask you the same question I asked you earlier. How do we find reliable sources that makes this kind of distinction? I contend that for nuances between terminology of this nature, it is virtually impossilbe to dig up RS that explicitly supports your position. I challenge you to find something that spells out what 'seems to us' to be the case. PBS&Shuki; - I think it's fair to ask ""can you provide ""a number of sources that makes the distinction"" between ""occupied territory"" and ""military occupation"""". But, at the same time I think it's equally fair to say ""can you provide a number of sources that says the two terms are the same?"". I think as PBS is suggesting a change from the historical norm, the onus of proof is on him. One final point (apologies for overly long posts); PBS keep in mind that there are undoubtly ""legal"" definitions for both these terms, but there are also definitions that exist in the public phsyci.

" It's a good suggestion. I would go a little further and offer this version of the entire paragraph that circumvents any mentioning of the 'claims': ""Although the empire had a multi-ethnic character during its history and preserved Romano-Hellenistic traditions, it became known to most of its western and northern contemporaries as the Empire of the Greeks due to the increasing predominance of the Greek element. The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romani instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors."" I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire. "

Read on talk page I have given detail explanation that Indian Buddhist Movement is a non secterian movement. Goenka, Ambedkar, Iyothi Das everybody has given hid contribution. Now British Buddhist, Japanese Buddhist are also helping the Buddhist Movement and it is growing. If you need any proofs I am ready to give. If you want to come India I'll arrange visits to different place to see how many people are converting to Buddhism from various Hindu castes.
" That doesn't mean your actual contributions were worthwhile. A bad contribution can be salvaged, but it's still a bad contribution. You may have started over a thousand articles, but most of those were still vague, useless stubs that other people had to edit before they were worth keeping. The fact that you still do this here and other places baffles me - you say ""experience"", but most experience tends to lead to doing things better. Even more baffling is the fact that some of the stubs you create are about subjects on which you have shown an almost singular focus, such as the Unification Church. It's like leaving dirty laundry around to remind someone else to wash it. Maybe you could help your case by showing us how many things are on your ""deleted contributions"" list? 76.105.223.232 "

Translation Help if Possible Hello, I'm trying to translate the Japanese Wikipedia page of the Mephisto Award and I've hit big snag since my own fluency is minor at best. My article has already been deleted once and I managed to have a admin restore but it's up for deletion again since it's sparse at the moment. If you could offer any help translating or just adding to the article in general I would really appreciate it. I would also appreciate if you could look over some of the book titles that I translated since I'm fairly certain they are wrong and I point out the ones I think I'm the most off on the talk page.

I modified that, everybody knows that that's Moldovans and Romanians are the same shit, anyhow the census will say it. They speak Romanian, and not Moldovan how they sustain. A Romanian understands perfectly when a Moldovan is speaking it's fuckin' language called Moldovan, and vice versa. Moldovans are doing this because they are a gang of betrayers and retarded that don't have idea what's their ancestry. Let's be reasonable now, even if I think that you people here are too stupid to understand this. They were Romanians until 1940, and suddenly they changed of ethnicity because they are an different country than Romania. ' 10 June 2006

I don't have desperately strong opinions about what should be included other than the two most widely recognised songs of Lennon's solo career. However, it seems to me that anyone who does have such an opinion ought first to make the case for whichever song(s) they want include on the talk page in order to gain consensus (if any can be reached). On that understanding, does it seem reasonable to trim the paragraph and leave a note in the article to direct people to the talk page?

Article length Before we go and start removing massive portions of the article I think we should take into consideration that many nation articles are quite a bit past the 100kb. The article of Russia is definately long (222kb) and is an excellent article (even used by the wiki community as an example of a good article) even though it has long subsections and many images. Length dosent mean that it's a poorly put together article. This article can work as a long article (and will probably need to in order to explain the complexity of mexico) as long as we provide information which provides accurate representative information.

Some English, please? Objectivity, as a method of philosophy, is dependent upon the presupposition distinguishing references in the field of epistemology regarding the ontological status of a possible objective reality, and the state of being objective in regard to references towards whatever is considered as objective reality.

I'm not saying that someone has to do it right now, I'm just writing this on the talk page so maybe someone pays attention to the fact that the article, as it stands, is pretty bad.

The first was a possible copyright violation (copy+pasted from another site?) and the second was that it appeared to merely be an advertisement, asserting no notability of the company. There's some good guidance at WP:CORP if you want to start there? Kind regards, 21:35

Dear Wikipedia assholes, I regret to inform you that because of deletionist scum such as Gavin Collins and J Milburn, I am planning to terminate my life. You see, Wikipedia was my life, and these deletionist bastards have ruined and deleted everything that I have worked so very hard to create. I spent over three years contributing to Wikipedia, improving the site, sacrificing grades in school to add to a revolutionary encyclopedia, but because of these low-life dip-shits whom I abhor in every molecule of my body, I have discovered that it was all for nothing. So I end my life, and I hope this will bring the wrath and resentment of the world down upon these deletionist jackasses. Sincerely, Vern Cork

Me ban I shouldn't have been banned. That was a complete abuse and utter bullshit. I hope you like the disruption you have caused to the project. My ban needs to be overturned so I can stop advocating for it to be undone. You guys took a dedicated editor and me out of the project just so you could keep pushing POV and free the admins to be abusive. I hope your happy. When my ban is overturned I'll walk away. But until then I a never going to stop commenting because it was abusive and never should have been allowed. Kumioko

Catholic Jihad against Evangelicals I want to post,write articles on masssacres,persecution,terrorism and repression by Catholics against baptists and pentecostals. Specially on baptist holocaust in Colombia(1948-1960). But you a Baptist,delete any reference to any wrong doing by catholics. What it can be made in relation to it. We Latin American Baptists had human rights,we had right to denounce crimes and atrocities comitted agaist us. Why you violate our freedom of speech rights?.

Article reorganization There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality. I think this article should be worded more like the homosexuality article, which distinguishes between homosexual orientation and same-sex relationships. Likewise, there needs to be a distinction between people with a heterosexual orientation and people who have sexual relationships with people of the opposite gender. I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear. For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation. On the other hand, the causality section is mostly about the development of a heterosexual orientation. That crucial element isn't clear. I am going to start reorganizing it like the homosexuality page.

" Incorrect speedy deletion You were incorrect to speedy delete Category:Science and technology in Myanmar. Firstly, this is a first level national subcategory that it standard issue for every country in the world above the level of a microstate, and such categories should NEVER be deleted. It should have been fixed instead. Secondly, it is was empty, I suspect you have played into the hands of someone who takes a non-neutral stance on the Burma/Myanmar naming issue, and has abused process by emptying the category without following due process on Wikipedia:Categories for discussion. I will be correcting your error later today when I have time. Actually, the discussion at the CFD you mentioned does seem to have clear concensus (no opposes, in fact), and this was just one of SEVERAL myanmar->burma categories that I deleted. Another user has removed all the articles from these categories and (I suppose) placed them into new categories as described in the CFD.

Commentary/analysis The following paragraph was posted on the main article page, but the analysis was unaccompanied by any no source citation to bolster its validity: The period marked a change in Japan after suffering a number of years of turmoil due to feuding between regional and local war lords. Power was gradually centralized by one warlord Oda Nobunaga who was able to control the regional daimyo and the residual kenmon to his material gain. Nobunaga was assasinated in 1582;and his projecte unification plans were taken up by his chief lieutenant, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Perhaps some or all of this material needs to be re-introduced?

To me a nemonic is supposed to provide an easy way to help you remember something. It shouldn't be hard to remember or hard to remember how to use. The second nemonic, I feel, is quite complicated, has much information buried in it, is hard to learn how it all goes together, and takes a significant amount of memory to remember how to use all its various parts. Given that, is it really a nemonic? A second thing I want to do is give for consideration the nemonic I learned way back when we used paper trig tables. Sorry, I do not know a reference for it. And I can not edit it in, because I don't know the markup here on Wiki. It is: OH, AH, Oh-Ah, Ah-Oh, HA, HO (Say it moderately fast). Sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant are: O/H, A/H, Oh/Ah, Ah/Oh, H/A, H/O. Unlike the soa-cah-toa nemonic it gives all six common functions. But I like to teach only the 1st three, OH, AH, Oh-Ah (simple enough), or even only the first two, OH AH and have them (students) memorize only Sin, Cos, and Tan then have them learn and understand that tan= sin/cos and the last three are inverses of the 1st three. It might sound a bit like a tongue twister at first, but it only took a my high school trig class about 15 minutes to learn it and a good part of that time was laughter and it is silly enough to be memorable. I still use it after 45+ years and some of my today's students have picked it up too as the one they prefer (over soh cah toa).

According to Umberto Eco, Goedsche in his novel Biarritz plagiarized Alexandre Dumas' Joseph Balsamo (as it says in the article) and Eugne Sue's Les mystres du peuple. But I think I've never heard that Goedsche directly borrowed from Joly. The common theory is that the motif of the conspirators' secret meeting on a cemetary (which Goedsche took from Dumas and Sue), after having been published independently from the rest of Goedsche's novel, was merged with material from Joly's satire to create the infamous Protocols. Weblinks I removed the first weblink, as it leads to a personal blog which (despite its title) contains nothing about Goedsche/Retcliffe whatsoever.

" You foolishly defer to quantity rather than quality in your opening statement. It is about the quality of the sources, not how many there are, and seeing as the most verifiable sources from your point of view have already been put forward here ad nauseum, your case that there is widely accepted verifiable and neutrally based evidence of the late Senator's neo-conservative legacy is seriously flawed. The citations you highlight at the forefront of your case are agenda-based so heaven knows how superfluously irrelevant the other sources are. Your very deference to the quantity of sources in your opening gambit reflects the tenuous nature of your argument. I refer you back to my vegetarian analogy. The tide of truth is flowing against you, desist from your misinformed unreliable agenda-based pigeon-holing of the late Senator or risk being swept away to the sea of ignorance. I refuse to let the late Senator's name become besmirched and mislabelled by a case built on subjective sources.

All the little kids with nothing better to do than make up memes have ruined any hope of NPOV. I have exposed numerous lies which have been deleted. Just because Hal Turner has a different viewpoint than you does not give you the right to make up slanderous lies about the man. Your viewpoint is not always correct, believe it or not, when you grow up, you may realize the error of your ways.
Bird Is the Most Popular Finger
I'm accused of sockpuppetry, but the author isn't. That makes no sense. You know, I've finally come to the realization that wiki is nothing but a bunch of american racists. I swear I will do everything in my power to disrupt your servers.
God damn you hectorine, nobody said anything about the article of Angelos elefantis about being in the wrong place, dont make up things..anyway i cant change now the article. i am almost about to think this place is run by greek mafia.

Blotto adrift - admit when you make a mistake. Several other users have pointed out corrections and you still change the pages back to your edits. You and people like you are a shame to wikipedia. ps - if you were a scholar, which your not - but somehow are allowed to edit, again going to the creditablity of this site - you would have access to scholars portal.
Hey Where is the article known as Helicopters in fiction? That page is what I edited alot once but now its deleted forever. Why the jets get a Popular Culture section while tanks, helicopters and ships get none?( )
Agreed Josette. Slot it slightly further down into the text.
I have a question. Most of the page is now comprised of information that lacks any reference what so ever. Why have you not caused a stink about that?
I just meant that it seems like an official enough source of casting news. The date is of course open to question.

Hello BeCritical, Well, I have to say that after reading your last message it is obvious that you haven't listened to anything I've said. Again, you have used a derogatory word when discussing Miss Clayton. You are not only offending her, you are literally offending every single trans person. I'm new to this but, I guess it really is true that behind computer screens people are big bullies. The reference I deleted is not just offensive to me, it is offensive to the entire LGBT community. A community that you obviously do not belong or relate to. Which makes me wonder why you are even concerned with Jamie's page. There are plenty of other references. I really do not understand why you care so deeply about including this one. I really hope that you and the people in your life you care about never experience the level of insensitivity you are displaying towards Miss Clayton.

" I do respect your views, but what we have here is slow but persistent long term kiddie vandalism. We did a big rewrite of the article in Aug-Sept 2010, and if you review the last year's edits virtually everything since then has been a vandal revert, usually an anon IP or new user account. This pattern is why most of the animal articles (cat, dog, pony, etc.) are under permanent semi-protection. It's an absolute pain in the butt to be constantly reverting this stuff. It isn't a 15 times a day problem like the current event or celebrity articles, it's just someone adding ""p-words"" or whatever to the article. (long, heavy sigh). So if you'd wish to reconsider, that's all I'd ask. Thanks!(talk) "

Are you an Idiot Mr Caribbean H.Q.? Why are you reverting my changes while I am still editing the page? Or is it just that removal of pro-American references, and any informed edits infuriate you? Please desist from reverting my changes unless you are sure that they are (1) quite finished and (2) unbiased. I suppose your thick head won't get some minor points of etiquette that are required of a real-world editor, given that you have won these all-powerful Wikipedia edits! Please, also, tell me if you are plain stupid or plain pro-American before reverting my changes. IN OTHER WORDS, PLEASE STOP VANDALISING MY EFFORTS AT WIKIPEDIA.

Also, I must say that I get banned for small simple edits, while several russians edit in and out bullshit (for people who don't ignore the obvious), or in other words russian propoganda (including the backwards mindset that Russia is not at all involved in crimea). If anything you should ban other editors for reverting my changes, both of whom again I remind you, are extremely biased and shouldn't be treated the same way given the circumstances of their background (government controlled media) and motive to misinterpret news to suit the pro russian view, especially that article holy shit

" I am not afraid of your threats (it's not an insult I talked nice to you). If you don't know about 94% of Albanians (who were in a poll) support terrorist so called ""KLA"". 6% of the rest were killed by KLA because they cooperated with Serbs. And albanians can't be ""normal people"" since they are not humans at all and absolutely not normal (what kind of human being could kill a innocent baby and burn it allive, or burn 300 churches for nothing)? Ok I understand that but why do you protect them? Anyway why don't we speak Serbian? In my life I never met an albanian (animal names are written with first letter little ) ) that didn't say I hope you 'll die at least 7 times when we met (I was talking nice to them untill they didn't insult without reason). I am very angry because of this and it's one more reason why I hate them. To me I don't consider a human anyone who supports Serbian Kosovo independence (it's like someone supports slaughtering milion of innocent children). Thank you very much for your support and if you were little more on the side of the truth I would award you, but sorry I can't do it right now. Good luck! ! "
Basically (I think) that you can either be supportive, neutral or directly against. Even this discussion shows people's views very clearly. Particularly, you can't actually judge people by what 'others' have done so people PLEASE DO NOT BE OFFENSIVE. It's not right. An encyclopedia should be entirely neutral, and show the views of both sides.

I don't have the time to learn how to discuss here. I have repeatedly warned this site of libel. It is not up to me to remove libel, you are the publishers of it. I like wiki, I don't want to take this legal and harm you. But when you are informed of libel, why are you unable to fix it? Why does it keep reappearing? I won't be talking here again, I have a life you know. Do you guys want lawyers and suits and all that? I have repeatedly sent emails about this, with no replies. YOu are taking huge huge huge risks in not doing something to stop the libel.

In any case, thank you very much for the offer. Okay, glad you're cognizant of the editcountitis zeitgeist.

" ""read the notice"" As you seem to be such a fan of procedure, perhaps you can tell me where the appropriate place is to complain about your decision to ignore valid criticism of the decisions to not post the arrest of Adams on the front page. I found the Village Pump, but I suspect you are just going to censor that to. I know you probably hoped that I would just forget about this and go away if you shut me down at Wikipedia talk:In the news, but you don't have to be a psychologist to figure out that was probably the worst thing you could have done. Not that I blame you of course, it's not like anyone could expect you to have any particular skills in this department. But I am hoping that at some point I will find someone here who is able to operate with a little more insight into human behaviour, and more importantly, is actually going to give me an honest and thoughtful answer to my queries. Which obviously, I don't consider the response so far to have been, at all. "

Also, baiting you to abuse your authority is completely justifiable, as nobody is forcing you to violate wiki policy-I may extend the invitation, but you alone are responsible for taking that step, as you have done repeatedly. You are. Mary, a total disgrace to the wiki community. You pick fights and then act like you're above it all when it looks like you cannot win. More like a schoolayard bully than a teacher, and as well all know, the best way to deal with bullies is to make their lives hell until they stop.

Disambiguation? Why does this article currently redirect from Pygmy Shrew? As there is another article about the Eurasian Pygmy Shrew, which is also commonly referred to as the Pygmy Shrew.

" Sorry, no? ""No"" is what a master says to a dog. ""No"" is what a parent says to a child.

Don't be a hypocrite, because ypu're speculating on Witkacy's motives when you are suspected of harbouring ulterior motives yourself. You are hardly in a position to judge or guess. This apathetic way of dealing with everybody on Wikipedia is also a violation of WP:Civility and WP:POINT. Nobody carews about how tough you think you are and how much you can push people around. Everything you are doing in effect is breaking WP:NPA. The two pages on VFD are pushed because they only violate the will of certain Jews. "

" Attempt to fly the aircraft upside-down? There's one sentence that seems to lack support: At one point, unable to raise the nose, they attempted to fly the aircraft ""upside-down"". This implies that the pilots deliberately tried to invert the plane, or at least keep it inverted after an unintended roll. Certainly the aircraft was inverted. But there doesn't seem to be any evidence that the inversion was deliberate. The CVR transcript (which is the only reference cited by this sentence) seems consistent with the notion that the inversion was unintended and that the pilots were trying to right the aircraft. So unless anyone knows of any citable source saying that the inversion was deliberate, I think this sentence should be changed. Especially because it can be confused with the movie Flight, where, in a similar situation, the pilots do deliberately attempt to invert the aircraft."
" I took a look at your first article, and added the tags deadend and unreferenced. deadend means that there are no links, and you can add links by adding two square brackets like [[this]].
