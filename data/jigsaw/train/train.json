While you may not consider it too important, I think the issue of Assange as the founder to be another example of lazy journalism. Your source for Assange as founder of Wikleaks was MSNBC.com. I don't necessarily consider MSNBC to be a reliable source most of the time. Corporate news does not do \"\"real\"\" journalism. They copy news from one source or they make stories up. It seems to me that the idea of Assange as founder is a meme. I have never read a quote from Assange whereby he states that he founded Wikileaks. This idea seems to be mostly promulgated by the U.S. corporate media. Perhaps to vilify him in the minds of Americans, so that later he can be lynched. This seems like Propaganda 101 to me. The Wikileaks site does not identify Assange as the founder. Where is the evidence? THC Loadee 04:08, 4 MARCH 2011 (UTC)\"",

East Coast people tend to think West Coast culture is too fluffy and superficial and West Coast people think the East Coast is too uptight and high-strung. So I don't think how Chicago/Great Lakes culture is viewed by people on the coasts shoould really have any bearing on whether or not it's a \"\"coast.\"\" Besides, I don't think the purpose is to compare the Great Lakes to the Eastern or Western seaboards.

A sad fact these are so rarely combined. I am hoping this may be a test case for WP itself.

He LEFT his KKK in 1980 which was the same time he LEFT the Democrats! Robert Byrd was a member of a KKK WHY ARE YOU NOT SMEARING AGAINST HIM???",

Edward Tufte: Before the development of spreadsheet graphing, the most common graphical mistake was the use of artist-drawn 3-D images with the height of 3-D objects representing the magnitude of the data points. In these charts, both the height and the width of the drawn object increase proportionate to the magnitude of the data points. The effect is to exaggerate the differences in magnitude as the viewer tends to perceive the area of the figures rather than just the height as representing the magnitude. (Source) The image suggests that the Tsar Bomba, which was three or four times more powerful than Castle Bravo, is actually 40 times larger in volume (or ~10x larger in area). If explosion volume went up by about the cube of the yield (not really accurate, but much closer than this chart) the Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud would be 1.5x taller than Castle Bravo and 15x taller than Hiroshima. Instead, the diagram shows the CB and TB over a thousand times taller. On this scale, one could conclude that since the Hiroshima bombing's mushroom cloud was about four miles high, the Tsar Bomba explosion (3,000x taller) must be larger than the Earth itself. 98.218.195.90 12:41, 6 July 2010",

The motors deliver their torque to gearbox in the Hydraulic drive assembly. This in turn delivers the force to two drive shafts. The forward one goes to the rotor assembly on the GAU-8 itself, while the second delivers it's power to the ammunition drum. Q. How long is typical spin-up time? A. While the system is capable of operating at 4200 rounds per minute, it is limited to 3900 while installed in the aircraft. Since the GAU-8 has 7 barrels it needs to spin at 1/7th of the firing rate. Basically since it's rotating a touch over 550 rpm the spin-up time is almost instantaneous. On another point the statement on the gun gas on affecting the engines is complete rubbish. During the firing of the GAU-8 the engines ingest so much gun gas that the engine igniters (think super spark plugs) must fire to ensure a stall does not occur. The engines also will ingest so much soot from the firings that they need to be \"\"water washed\"\" (have water and a mild cleaning solution misted into the engines while running at approx. 80% power) periodically to remove soot from the blades. Anyone who has had to clean an A-10 will tell you the gun gas goes just about everywhere aft of the nose.\"",

Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that \"\"he is one of the fairest players I have managed\"\" holds no weight since: 1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years. 2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much.

The scare quotes are setting off that word or phrase for special consideration. We have a vested interest in trying to get the reader to take special notice of each image of artwork that we include in an article. If we are going to argue that Wikipedia is not an art gallery or that these thumbnails are hardly impressive in their dimensions and scarceness of detail, then why bother including images of famous paintings at all? I think we all agree that the images are all educational in an art historical kind of way.

Simmons does not write classic \"\"hard science\"\" science fiction like the old masters Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein. Instead he writes a form of grandiose social SF which is sometimes related to the social SF or Soft science fiction tradition of Bradbury, Le Guin, Vance and others. I wanted to do fast justice to his continuation, in his own very particular style, of that tradition by making a rapid allusion to the fact that his literary approach is really not space opera.

Adults had suggested the Brookwood Bears and the color of Carolina Blue , but in a 3-0 vote the student committee led by Michael E. Schmidt selected the Bronco and the colors burgandy and gold. The Brookwood school song and fight song were selected by Dr. Michael E. Schmidt and Brookwoods first band director the late Stewart Hughes. Laura Zieker BHS first choir teacher wrote the words to Brookwoods school song. Both songs were based upon the songs from Tucker High School. Dr. Michael E. Schmidt arranged the first arrangement of Brookwood High Schools fight song. The BHS administration had originally wanted Brookwoods colors to be Orange and Blue like the Denver Broncos, but the student committee led by a Parkview High School student [ hs senior Dr. Schmidt] rejected those colors because they are the same colors as Brookwoods rival Parkview High School. [ Both of the two other students on that committe were junior transfers from South Gwinnett HS] The colors chosen were maroon and gold which were based upon the colors of Florida State University. The runner-up choice for Brookwoods color was Carolina blue. The original Brookwood HS logo/mascott selected by the three student committee was a full bronco surrounded by a horseshoe.

That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a \"\"kangaroo court\"\" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus. The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism. Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted. So I studied Eleland a little. I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles. Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem. Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script. Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have? Can anything be done?

There are two problems with Jza84's sumarizing language and overall conception of this page. First, in terms of dividing territory geographically, there is no \"\"merely\"\" involved. Territorial division is a serious and often deadly issue. Moreover, Brits tend to be more tolerant of the mixing of cultural, ethnicity, and legal issues because they live without a written constitution. Jsa84 could learn from this attitude. The second revealing problem with Jsa84's language is that Jsa84 underscores geographically as if this modifier is going to clarify anything. The discpline of geography is made up of several branches and, until you specify whether you mean political geography or other kinds of geography, you haven't resolved anythingyou haven't even begun. This page is one of the more inconsisent pages available, and not just internally, but in relation to other pages that deal with consitutional and cultural issues in the United Kingdom. I recommend that Jza84 begin to accept the help of others in the Wikipedia community. Otherwise, these pages will continue to look confused. Dylan Hunt \"",

However in searching via Google, I found this article, http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12529-1890873_2,00.html This to me seems rather striking, to have somebody talking so openly about speed. Maybe we could change the article around to be, In spite of his penchant for speed, Clarkson holds a clean driving licence. None the less, he is not especially reluctant to discuss the subject of speed. In a November 2005 article in \"\"The Sunday Times\"\", Mr. Clarkson wrote, while discussing the Bugatti Veyron, \"\"On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240mph\"\", and later, in the same article, \"\"From behind the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldnt believe me\"\". Could we write that ? These two quotes are rather remarkable, in my opinion, and worth mentioning in the article. They demonstrate his honest and frank manner of discussing his travels across Europe. And we could just leave it to the reader to decide if he is talking about going 240mph on public roads, or whatever. I realize you may feel differently about Mr. Clarkson than I do, but none the less, these two quotes do clarify his penchant for speed, and are worth mentioning, alongside his clean driving record, I would say. \"",

I've been heavily involved in OWS since last October, which means two things: 1) I know a bunch of stuff first-hand, including things the media has failed to document, and 2) sometimes an NPOV is going to be difficult for me to maintain. That said, I have many concerns with this article, mostly on the facts. For example, this quote above: the rules of Zuccotti Park aren't self-justifying; this quote and others in the article seem to indicate that they are actually material. They're not; they don't actually exist; there is a rule-making procedure that is required by city law which the police and Brookfield have totally ignored. So, using them to explain police action without quoting or citing a police source is not NPOV. Secondly, these rules have nothing to do with the police tactics used that day, which were employed all over the Financial District, well outside the region where the \"\"rules\"\" of Zuccotti Park apply. What happened was the police grab whoever they feel like at any given moment, apply laws like the disorderly conduct statute willy-nilly (\"\"blocking pedestrian traffic\"\" is frequently absurdly applied), and have a goal not of enforcing laws but of maintaining an extralegal standard of order. This is called \"\"crowd control policing\"\", and it explicitly involves unconstitutional conduct and arrests. Remember, sometimes a point of view is political despite being neutral, i.e. based in empirical observation and fact. Thanks for your work, and perhaps you can offer some guidance as to how first-person expertise can properly be used to make sure a wiki article is factual and not based on flawed or incomplete media interpretation. \"",

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.

As Wikipedia's own article on dehydration and the article on human urine notes, drinking urine, like drinking saltwater, does nothing at best, and increases the rate of dehydration at worst. Normal urine contains about 95% water and 5% dissolved solids, much of which is salts. The more dehydrated you are, the higher the percentage of salt in the urine. Your body is only about 1% salt. Water follows a diffusion gradient, so water *leaves* your cells to dilute the urine. The kidneys can pump ions out of your blood to try and lower the salt concentration, but not *that* effectively. Just like drinking seawater to survive is stupid and nearly universally recommended against, you shouldn't survive on urine, either. And here, we're just talking about the salt, let alone the ammonia, nitrates, aldehydes, and other toxins that your body is trying to get rid of. And all of this assumes that it doesn't make you vomit outright and lose even more water. To viewers of the show: don't do it! Of course, we're not allowed to mention anything except for the press release blurbs on the article itself. P ==",

At any rate, with the order of Isabella and Ferdinand, the thousands upon thousands of Spanish Conquistadors who invaded America, and Columbus, himself, did basically cause the destruction of many of the New World Mongoloids (whose ancestors had crossed the land bridge from Asia to America many centuries before). How strange is Mankind? Two centuries before Columbus, the Mongoloids were responsible for the destruction of many Europeans (especially Eastern Europeans) during the Mongol Empire. Later, it would be the Europeans causing the destruction of many of the New Word Mongoloids in America. It's like Ghengis Khan = Christopher Columbus (with a special nod to Isabella and Ferdinand).

(honest question) . Conversely, the majority of say islamic terrorists explicitly claim religious reasons for their actions (although other politico-economic issues may be as important if not more important than their ostensible reasoning). (Or one could say that there is a bias in the reporting/research causing this imbalance, but the result is the same as far as wikipedia is concerned) This certainly does not mean one group is better or worse than the other - but just that reliable sourcing on the specific topic of CT is not nearly as available as other religious terror movements.",

But there are many variants of these diagrams (e.g. workflow diagrams, workflow nets and even some dialects of Business process modeling are graphically similar) the definition given here is not 'activity diagrams' which is sort of a reserved keyword for the definition of OMG. So, moving the text to Process-data diagram seems a very good idea and would satisfy me fully. Or even leaving it where it is in metadata modeling if that is the term they use to refer to this kind of models, and removing the redundant text from metamodeling page as I initially suggested (hmm, took out my hatchet and did it!). I think what went wrong is the interpretation of the discussion at the top of this discussion page: people were complaining that metamodeling page was polluted by Utrecht definition of the term, and that by 'squatting' the term, some information on the more generally accepted definition of the term ended up on this [metamodeling technique] page. But I think the more generally useful info was extracted from that page already. The merge was suggested as a way of providing an example \"\"provided it is very clear this is not the definition of metamodeling\"\". To conclude if the page metadata modeling contains the description of this modeling formalism, I suggest we cut it from the text of this page, and maybe just add a \"\"see also\"\" pointing to the other page.

Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one.

In the lexicon used in footnote [9], the most accurate definition would be II A 3: \"\"Marcher vite\"\", (\"\"walking fast\"\")and \"\"filer\"\" (\"\"to go fast\"\"). This is consistent with most of the synonyms of \"\"tracer\"\" that denote movement, such as \"\"aller trs vite\"\" or \"\"courir\"\" . It ties in with the fact that parkour is described as \"\"moving around obstacles with speed and efficiency\"\".

I would like to say that nobody WP:OWNS Wikipedia articles, and it is against Wikipedia policy to use the term 'vandalism' for an essentially 'POV' issue (POV means someone expressing a point of view) - especially one that is effectively factual - namely the NF being 'far-right'. Wikipedia describes the NF as \"\"a far right and whites-only party\"\" in its main article - and this fact was as true when Griffin was a member of it as it is now. I also gave the clear reasons for removing the promotionally-phrased last line - so I'm not a vandal. Having maintained that the National Front is indeed 'far right', can anyone really claim that adding this fact to this article is unhelpful or irrelevant? The current introducton gives very little real flavour of Nick Griffin (and his obvious 'notoriety' is left out completely), which compared to other Wikipedia articles on politicians is pretty scandalous in my eyes. Why be so accommodating to Griffin of all people? It looks like whitewashing is going on to me.

Within the medical establishment, a medical student who has not yet received his or her MD is referred to as an \"\"undergraduate\"\", in contrast with residents who've received their MDs but are not yet board-certified. In that context, a medical student is an \"\"undergraduate\"\" because he or she has not graduated from the MD program. However, that does not mean that an MD is an \"\"undergraduate degree\"\" as that term is usually understood in the US. That term is reserved for bachelor degrees; any program (such as medical school or law school) which is generally attained after four-year college is called a \"\"graduate program\"\", and the degrees it grants are \"\"graduate degrees\"\". I think that the current wording is adequate to avoid this confusion. It's worth noting that in practice, it's extremely rare to find a medical student in the US who doesn't already have a degree from a four-year college.

Well, surprise surprise there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc.

He simply said that Prince Albert's new title of Count de Grimaldi would be inherited to his descendents just as the titles of the former Royal and Noble German States; equal inheritance, which means (in case you did not know) that ALL children of a Count would gain the style of Count or Countess.

However, it was (together with all criticisms) removed/censored by POV pushing editors. No control for mass was done in either experiment, and evaporation of order of less than microgram per second could easily explain the effect (especially in the NASA case); even more so, if there is some moisture. What you are essentially doing, is microwaving the interior of a cone, and - surprise surprise - there is a small force in the opposite direction. Then you turn off the heating, but your interior is still at higher temperature, measure it again, and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that. Also, some of experiments were done in atmosphere (at atmospheric pressure, even in chamber?! according to brief paper), so other possibility is interaction with heated air. However, in vacuum, ablation seems to be most likely explanation. Why all this sourced material and all criticism was removed, beats me. 213.198.221.171",

He told the New York Times. \"\"There are various interpretations possible: The big increase in hurricane power over the past 30 years or so may not have much to do with global warming, or the models are simply not faithfully reproducing what nature is doing.

In 2005, a few weeks before Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, Emmanuel asserted in a paper that he had found statistical evidence linking rising hurricane energy and global warming. His conversion is a very important new development in the climate debate, said Marc Morano, a top aide to climate change skeptic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. \"\"First, 2007 turned out to be the tipping point for global warming fears, and 2008 appears to be the year of vindication for skeptics as many prominent scientists reverse their climate views, more and more skeptical scientists speak out, and new data debunks man-made climate fears.

The Marines gave him an honorable discharge. Of course this is unverifiable even though I have all of the Marine Records, FBI records, Medical Records, Police Records, Texas Department of Public Safety Records, interviews with Whitman's professors, friends, victims and a few members who were in his Boy Scout Troop when he was a Scout Master in Austin. So I am not qualified to speak on Whitman in the article as the history on the article page will show. Also, my interviews with Martinez and McCoy are audio, so they can't be used either because of WP:COI and verifiability, even though my name is used in a few of the sources in the article on Whitman.

Also, I am not talking of this ORIGINAL TOWN of Miller or is supposed boundaries but The Miller Beach Area today is made up of many neighborhoods to simply call Miller Beach a Neighborhood of Gary makes the very notion of Miller smaller than it really is... I don't have agenda here. I just don't want my home town slighted by mis-information. It is the word Neighborhood that is of issue. Miller Beach has several Neighborhoods... It was settled almost 100 years before Gary was established. It is town that has been annexed. It is not a neighborhood of Gary. It existed before Gary. These are historical facts.

As soon as I posted it up, you decided to be a douchebag and just write all nonsense below it, before anyone could even say yes I agree or disagree. I suggest you don't talk to me again. I don't like when people are biased and rude.\"",

They prop each other up in spats on various talk pages; they support each other's articles in the FAC process (effectively devaluing the process as a result); and seem to enjoy stalking and baiting other users. To be frank, I think it's best to treat these little boys with the contempt they deserve. Eventually they'll get bored and start creeping round someone else. Ever heard of the forest Ton Sak Yai in Uttaradit? A few days ago I uploaded an article about Buaco Forest in Portugal. Next I intend to write a piece about Ton Sak Yai. The forest is home to the world's largest teak tree.",

A wikiproject is designed to give a community for editors to collaborate on a subject, it's not meant to be official policy.

But after looking around, Ive realized that the shocking part is that public does not know what goes on behind the scenes here at Wikipedia. I shall strive to educate my friends about this horrendous jungle. What a shame. I congratulate ragib and InShaneee on their power. Enjoy. I can imagine what you had to do to become admins.

The Safavids (1501-1722) were a Turkic-speaking Shiite dynasty which ruled Iran from 1502 till 1722 (though several Safavid rulers were nominally reigning until 1736)[3]. The Safavid empire originated in the city of Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and had its origins in the Shiite Safaviyyeh Order. Safavids combined the elements of Turkic tribal militancy with Persian cultural identity and the Shiite teachings of Islam to assert the contemporary Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiite identity. During their reign, Safavids established a vast Iranian empire including the whole of modern Iran and the parts of modern Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, South Caucasus and Turkey. After we finally agree on the introduction, let's discuss next the origins part. Thanks.",

The reason is that k varies very rapidly with T so that it is usually only convenient to study a small range of T, here 590-660 K. The true y-axis at x = 1/T = 0 corresponds to infinite T and is very far from the experimental range, or \"\"way off the graph\"\". If we insist on a graph which goes to x = 0, the measured points will cover only a small part of the graph which would make it hard to understand. (It would also have led to inaccurate determination of Ea in the days when slopes were determined manually with graph paper, although this is no longer true since slopes are now determined by linear regression with a spreadsheet such as Excel.) So instead of replacing the graph, I will explain in the article that the left side of the graph is not in fact the y-intercept, and that ln A corresponds to the true y-intercept which must be calculated. Putting a // on the x-axis is also a good idea which I have seen in some textbooks, if someone has the software to re-draw the graph that way. \"",

I.e. something like \"\"Luther's Small Catechism, the Catechism Bach taught to students at the Thomasschule\"\" (assuming it was Thomasschule, as I have no idea) instead of a simple link. Also, Christian symbolism in Bach's works is certainly an interesting topic, and it is already mentioned in the \"\"Style\"\" section. Perhaps one day someone will feel bold enough to create something like Musical style of Johann Sebastian Bach, and then we'd have enough space to elaborate on this aspect of Bach's work.

Nearly all the C++ vendor implement in this fashion. Note also: The C++ deque cannot be implemented using an array. There is a requirement that references to elements in the middle of a deque remain valid if only the only thing done to the deque is add new elements at either end.

In response to your suggestion, I found a page-creation extension that automatically inserts the contents of another page into the new page: http://www.chainsofreason.org/wiki/Chains_of_Reason:Create_a_new_chain I think this is a great improvement, so thanks for the suggestion. However, as you will see on the above page, users still have to work-out for themselves what number they should give a new chain. And if it is not a recycled number, then they have to first add the new chain title to the top of the list at the bottom of the page, so it would be good to be able to also automate this process of determining what number to give a new chain, taking into account the need to recycle the titles of any deleted chains. Any ideas?!",

What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",

In September I [notified DavidRubin about Guido's behaviour http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Davidruben#Guido_-_up_to_his_old_tricks_again.3F] but he chose not to do anything, so it certainly isn't as if DavidRuben is just waiting for an excuse to ban Guido.

I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not. So its ok for them to make personal attacks on me but when I criticise Blixx and co I get punished. One rule for one and one rule for another eh?

I'm not sure whether we need to include the Telegraph article in the criticism section now as it's mentioned earlier, so I'll take that bit out. You can always restore it if you don't agree though. Another thing we may need to add is some viewing figures for the film's US and UK television debuts. Finding them for the UK seems quite straightforward, but I can't seem to track them down for the US. If you can help with that it would be much appreciated. Cheers 13:26",

Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).

There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as \"\"Ballast Point\"\" then. This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

My contributions have been done over a 3-year period and tend to focus on page maintenance of subjects I have knowledge of, like Monterey County, other Northern California locations, western Iraq towns, military & Navy subjects, and railroading. I did nominate 21 stub pages for speedy deletion in rapid succession, but did so with the hope that an administrator would rule on my suggestions, which they did (denying rapid deletion) and I accept it. It was done in good faith and I have apologized several times for the scramble-edit, explained in the initial unblock request above. On a subsequent ANI thread, an administrator commented at the end of the post added here that a positive step would be for me to apologize. I have done so in a genuine manner here, here and here.

The legitimacy of claims of atrocity are debateable for this reason, 'since Sunni Arabs are too honorable to do any such things'. The distinction between those who have died in military style combat or executed under the direction of a lawful court of President Saddam Hussein, although buried disrespectfully, and those who have been victims of genocide, ethnic cleansing or otherwise murdered innocently and buried efficiently is a bright line; mass burial should not be assumed to be evidence of criminal activity. 'These Shia and Kurds were traitors to Iraq and were fairly tried and executed by the patriot Arab Sunnis for their crimes', although the burial was not always respectful. Victims of chemical weapons are unknown, 'and they too were traitor Kurds and deserved the punishment by the patriotic Saddam government'.",

He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia. How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member. So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda. Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources. I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period. I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals.",

Moreover, in another poll (Rede Globo Mineira, 2000) in the populous State of Minas Gerais, Chico Xavier, the most popular spiritist medium in Brazil, was elected the Mineiro (Minas's citizen) of the century, competing against other popular celebrities like the former President Juscelino Kubischeck and inventor Santos Dumont.

Therefore your edit was entirely inappropriate and for that reason I'm going to revert it. The block that you refer to was for using a 1-month-old consensus as the basis to protect an article from a gang of edit warriors. Whilst it's already fallacious due to the fact that it's entirely an ad hominem argument, it's even more dubious because you yourself are trying to use the discussion on this talk page as the basis to support Mzilikazi's illegal edits. If one reads the June 2012 discussion here, they'll see a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue. How is a 1.5-year-old unresolved issue justification for Mzilikazi's latest edit war when a 1-month-old consensus is apparently so worthless that I deserved to be blocked for implementing it? Besides, this talk page certainly wasn't the entire discussion; you're cherry-picking and you know it full well. In reality, Mzilikazi conceded defeat in the first edit war here, hence both Aesop and Aesop's Fables returned to their BC/AD state after 1.5 years of Mzilikazi bullying anyone who tried to undo his illegal changes. The status quo was protected for many months until Mzilikazi used his sock puppet Afkun to start a 2nd edit war 7 months later. Mzilikazi was the original and main trouble-maker on your side of the first edit war, Dougweller, so by completely ignoring his concession of defeat and cherry-picking evidence in an attempt to claim you won is outrageous and shows just how little value one should place on your thoughts here.

This means those pics are rather old and it's unlikely that they still have any copyright. 2004 is not rather old. Images published in the United States before 1923 are old. The images you uploaded are probably copyrighted. If the website you found them on does not explicitly say that the images are released under a free license or into the public domain, you have to consider them copyrighted and unavailable for use. You could consider emailing the photographer and asking them to release it under the GFDL, though. Take a look at this page Wikipedia:Image use policy, this page Wikipedia:Image copyright tags, and this page Wikipedia:Copyrights. Your images will probably be deleted unless you can show they are free to use. (Talk)",

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south americas distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know. Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans dont view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture.

Canada declared war on the German Empire in 1914 as a integral part of the British Empire which was threatened as a whole, not as an independent country in isolation. Currie in 1914 would have regarded himself as defending the British Empire, not Canada in isolation, which was under no individual threat from Germany in the least. I understand the enthusiasm for Canadian patriotism, but it doesn't really make historical sense to use allegiance to Canada in this context, & it's a mistake to take contemporary sentiments & backdate them onto the past like this, where sentiment was different in these matters. It would make sense to put military allegiance to the British Empire with that symbol for Currie's martial career, & the Canuck Red Ensign (great flag, which should be re-introduced today imo, by the way) next to his nationality or birthplace, but putting military allegiance to Canada in the context of WW1 doesn't make contemporary historical sense?

Truly sad, indeed. Also, regardless what you want to refer to the chinese as, china is the reason why the US's economy is in the crapper, and why our unemployment rate is higher than it has been since the early 1980's. We have made \"\"those people\"\" rich while our economic infrastructure is crumbling. Open your eyes! And for those reasons, I despise China as well as the politically correct. Niggardly It is apparent by reading wiki's page on the \"\"controversial\"\" word \"\"niggardly\"\", that stupid people and words do not mix. It has been said that most people never pick up a book after leaving high school. Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language. As I said, idiots and words can be a dangerous combination. What is even sadder is that I expressed this comment on wiki's niggardly page, and was accused of vandalism, yet others posted similar comments.

Unless, you get a reasonable explanation from him on the 4 edits I have mentioned above, there is no point calling this edit-warring as its a clear-cut case of vandalism.

The Vedic Rajas & old Kshatriyas(tribals),not satisfied with their married wives,had frequently children by their female slaves,who although not legitimate successors to the throne,these illegitimate children were styled Rajpoots,or the children of Rajas\"\"The word \"\"Rajput\"\" is used in certain parts of Rajasthan to denote the illegitimate sons of a Kshatriya chief or Zamidar.\"\" [Mahajan: 1972: 550 ff.] The conclusion is obvious that they were not considered by the original residentsto be respectable, to start with. This is because \"\"Raaja\"\" means royal but \"\"Raj\"\" means semen. The progeny of mixed marriages is even now called by that name in some parts. The condition of woman was deteriorating. The question of women education was unthinkable. Obscene Art flourished during Rajput age. The originality of the ancient times was lost and the ancient culture degenerated. The country fell into the hands of Rajput barons, soon to be followed by the Mohammedan invaders who completed the work of annihilation.

Since you decided to step in and harass me too I have to share new research finding with you as well: 90% of men are gay 100% of women are gay Rape and incest is an epidemic All races, cultures, nationalities, groups, and religions are secretly racist Most women are secretly sexist Drug and alcohol abuse is abundant Dyslexia affects 90% of the population and is commonly undiagnosed and treatable Mental illness is commonly undiagnosed and incurable Sociopaths need to be separated from normal society Humans have evolved from primates. There are the alpha males, the regular males and the females. Gay males have female minds. At one point in human embryonic development all people were once female. That is why males have nipples. Females have the ability to achieve a muscular orgasm just like a male, however most women do not know how. Women can have a muscular orgasm if they repeatedly squeeze the vaginal muscle used to urinate. Secret racism and secret sexism can be avoided by simply vocalizing the secret.\"",

FUCK FUCK. FUCK.\"\" Source . I would not put too much weight on what he means. I don't think such comments are funny. Anarchist Greetings Anna Quist\"",

First of all, I don't have a negative attitude towards the Romans, or the Greeks, or the Macedonians or anyone from Western antiquity. I'm really not that interested in Classical history beyond basic knowledge. What I AM interested in is keeping the wiki clean. As far as having the article locked, it was put into what's called \"\"semi-protected\"\" mode. In semi-protect, anonymous users cannot edit the article, and neither can newly registered accounts. This is to prevent vandalism from occuring - people putting in nonsense or swearing for no reason, that kind of thing. By the time you read this note you should have had your account long enough that you can now edit the article. I will warn you that trying to put in uncited material or stuff that goes against the manual of style will probably be deleted again, although not by me. Another suggestion would be to use the Apollo discussion page to air your concerns. Two of the five wikiprojects that have staked a claim on Apollo ( Wikiproject Classical Greece and Rome and Wikiproject Mythology) are known for their accuracy and attention to detail. They can probably give you reasons for why the content looks like it does. One last note, if you want to leave me a message again, please to it here at this link to my talk page, rather than on my main user page.

Which one should it be? \"\"Fulgurites have often deep penetrations, sometimes appearing up to 15 meters (50 feet) below the lightning-struck surface.\"\" \"\"The longest fulgurite found is approximately 4.9 to 5 meters (17 feet) in length, and was found in northern Florida, USA.\"\"\"",

I do relise that when a revert happens, a person gets a notice. I was hoping you would spot the obvious error (#1) atleast, but alas, you bark out idiot. I haven't clue why you did this as there was no reason. I just fixed Angel (Madonna song). First of all, try to understand why it was done. Did you open this reference and see whether Angel is present here at all or not? Guess not. Second of all, the book reference is the one to be used, PROMUSICAE be damned or not. Thirdly, hung medien is NOT the official site for old song in Spain, they post from 2004 onwards. And using both the book as well as the template with the same reference name as \"\"spain\"\" gives a reference error.

In the 1930s racist scientists lived in racist societies, both here and in Germany, and their work was used to justify and promote horrible things. But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion. When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny. If the consensus was that they met notability standards (beyond your simple assertion that they did) then the articles would have withstood review. I even offered to change my opinion if you could demonstrate notability. Last I heard, \"\"because WebHamster\"\" says so is not a reliable independent source that i am aware of, nor is that stated anywhere on in WP.

I don't think it as a conspiracy to undermine sovereign Ireland, put us down, offend us, somehow claim our territory or subsume us back into the union, the way some people on here seem to take it.

And as far as that sort of pathetic wikipolitics goes, that's at least one thing they do seem to have a learning capacity for. Just look at how many new words and phrases they've learned in that regard, just from that one ANI, which will no doubt come in handy the next time they fuck up and delete something for being a BLP violation when it isn't, or asking for signs of notability for in-article content, or any of the other stupid things he does, and repeats because he just won't be told, because he's an incompetent. I'm sure the project will flourish if it self-selects editors who only have that skill, while kicking out the ones who do know their arses from their elbows, and can actually write content without making a fucking balls up of it at step 1.",

Second, the example in question is quite an extreme case, where the child had a number of complications which meant it did not survive, and the genital ambiguity was one aspect of those complications. I would worry that people seeking information and support would find this paper quite shocking, and as you are no doubt aware, it is an extremely rare case which has limited bearing on the experiences of the majority of intersex people. So, is it a representative image (and link) on intersex? No, it is not. So, why is it there? Finally, I resist the reduction of intersex issues to simply being about genital ambiguity - just as I resist the reduction to XY/XX chromosomes and all that entails. I am sure that there would be better, fully consensual, images available if required - although I am not sure why they are necessary. People who are involved with intersex in some way will not find it informative or helpful, so the only purpose appears to be either for 'shock' value or voyeurism, neither of which seem valid reasons for having the picture on Wikipedia.",

And sure enough- you have pictures of Malcolm X, former leader of the Nation of Islam, which is essentially the black KKK. What a fucking joke. Go cry about white; nothing in my last entry was untrue- the only thing that's even remotely questionable is my line about the majority of people in Ghettos dropping out of school and having teen pregnancy (but it is true). But why did you delete the segment about people getting scholarships to Harvard, or the fact that there are black politicians- are these bits original research? You and your black KKK buddies need to stop living in the fucking 1700s and wake up to the present- the whole world over is all about Meritocracy and Plutocracy, not race.

Remember that Taiwan was pretty much a nonissue for both the CCP and the KMT before World War II, with Mao even being quoted in the 30's as supporting Taiwan independence from Japan. Why Taiwan and not Mongolia? Well politics basically... the PRC's need to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union at the time and to drum up support against \"\"western imperialism\"\" and CKS's Taipei regime. CKS of course also recognized Mongolia in the 20's or 30's to try to woo Soviet support, but \"\"revoked it\"\" (ha ha) after 1949 as there was no need to try to placate the Soviets anymore. Today CKS and Mao are long gone but the shadow of their vendettas still remain. - \"",

There are some sources here that support the idea that various types of nuclear power have been considered as sustainable, but that wasn't the only reason the IPs edits were reverted. This is one reason tying this into the above discussion is a bad idea, because this isn't just about the academic consensus on a loosely defined \"\"type of nuclear fission\"\". Using the article to explain in context that nuclear power is in some ways sustainable, according to some points of view, would be fine. The edits introduced large quantities relatively weakly sourced material to present nuclear as being a primary and uncontroversial source of sustainable energy. The above sources support mentioning nuclear as one aspect of sustainability. They do not warrant altering the article to make nuclear energy the first specific section, nor do they warrant excessive ref-bombing to support that perspective, while using similarly selective tactics to undermine those who hold a more critical perspective. This isn't just about verifiability, this is also about WP:WEIGHT. Even the sources presented here indicate that nuclear's sustainability is under-researched and hinges on too many unknowns to be accepted without further comment. This is true for many areas of sustainable energy research, but especially nuclear. It is an active area of research (or areas, rather) which has a relatively small but extremely vocal core of active supporters. This should not be used to diminish that perspective or the potentially revolutionary research, but major context was being selectively left-out from the proposed edits. \"",

To be safe, make sure you present information in a neutral and unbiased fashion - do not add promotional language. Present Pros and Cons - a clear indication that you are attempting to be unbiased in your presentation. Keep \"\"external links\"\" to a minimum and use inline citations instead. \"\"Official Website\"\" is sufficient. If you get a great review from an outside, independent source, reference it. Don't use paid inclusions or PR material - again a red flag because they are not unbiased. The standards are written up pretty well here WP:CORP. Good luck. \"",

In regional transport we can find seats aligned with the tracks to give more room to the standing passengers. In scenic trains seats are beeing orientied some degrees to the window are used. Some design variants have curved banks of seats to form a lounge. Flip flop seats that can be changed from face to face to face to back orientation are not used much due to its weights and consequences of the additional mechanism. While this information could still be valuable, I don't think it's worded very well here. Besides, the seating arrangements are different for each car type, and this text deals more with coaches than other types.

As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth. What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format. As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job.

A prerequisite is that attendance at the school should be reliably sourced - no source must mean no inclusion. The second prerequisite is notability. A page is not needed to demonstrate notability but it helps! Looking at the red-links some have no claims to notability and for some the claims can be simply tested. Take Mike Pointing for example. If he has played in a competitive match for Harlequins first team then he meets WP:Athlete. If he has just played for their academy then he doesn't. If Michael Latham is an influential film-maker why doesn't he have a page? My view is that if an editor thinks that an alumnus is notable and feels strongly that they should be included in this list then write a stub! It is always quicker to write a stub than have a long debate trying to establish their notability separately. To deal with this situation efficiently I am proposing that red-linked or unsourced people should be moved here. This preserves the information that we have about them and they can then be moved back to the article as sources are found or notability is demonstrated. Views, please. I'm with you, TerriersFan. Move the redlinks here or give a diff to the deletion; they can be added back when the burden of proof is met. I too agree with your suggestion. Thanks for taking this on. ==",

        "sentence": "\" I think having wikipedia in here sounds like a good idea, at least because it seems to me that wikipedia is a very well-known example of free culture. That wikipedia is a part of free culture should be pretty self-apparent from the way it's defined in the article (\"\"social movement[s] that [promote] the freedom to distribute and modify creative works, using the Internet as well as other media\"\"), and from the license used. The self-referencing seems ok, as the text says that writing about wikipedia is ok where it's relevant. If wikipedia is an example of online free culture, then it's relevant. As for wikipedia not using copyrighted material without permission, I don't see that as any stranger than FLOSS not gobbling up proprietary software. Free culture things are things that let you copy, distribute and modify them. Proprietary things generally don't, and so using them without permission isn't allowed, and therefore you can't include them in free culture things and have the free culture things remain free (or even legal). If you want to use copyrighted pictures and such on wikipedia, it seems to me that is to ask the owner to change the license, or at least follow fair usage guidelines. \"",

I don't see anything about this in the manual of style or in the TV-specific guidelines at WikiProject Television. This might be a matter that could be taken there to see if there's a consensus on what should be done. I personally think we should go with what the episode credits say (using things like Jeffrey Lieber and J.J. Abrams & Damon Lindelof). This way, we preserve the information about who worked together and who worked separately. Since the information is in a table and not in the middle of a sentence, I see no reason to correct grammar here (and I'm usually really picky about grammar). The best example that comes to mind is Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl where the credits list writers as Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert. Clearly, the first two worked together, while the last two worked independently of the others. I think that information is important and (if it were an episode of a TV series) should be listed as such in the episode table. Whenever I type in writers, I always go with whatever the episode says (of course, from what I can remember, I've never dealt with an episode from more than two writers before).

Liquid fire helps burn off blemishes such as warts, boils, and blisters. It is used in many dermatologists around the world. It was also used in construction work to help get rid of walls. They would rub the liquid fire on the wall and let it burn the wall down. Daria Huerta was one of the world's most smartest women of her time. She also created common things such as the coffee cup, pillow, and the sink. The product went into stores in 1961. It was sold at stores like Walmart, CVS, Wallgreens, and Pharmacies all over the world. It was originally called \"\"Fire in the Water\"\" then they started calling it what it truly is \"\"Liquid Water\"\". Liquid water sold for $10.00 per box. Each box contains 7 15x10 jars full of Liquid Fire. Daria Huerta created the Cark. She was playing around with genes from a shark and a cat one day. A year later she created a mutated creature. It was half shark, half cat. She then released it into the wild in 1990. The Cark started destroying the whole ecosystem. They had to destroy the Cark which took about 5 years. In 1995 she then decided it was time for her to quit science so she became a seamstress. She was playing around with yarn and discovered a thin piece that had ripped off which she then used to clean her teeth. This was called floss. In 2000 she created flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and wintermint. Huerta died in 2001. The Picture Below is the ONLY Picture of the original Cark: /Users/Maddy/Pictures/sharkcat.jpg\"",

There has been considerable study of Marx and there is no reason that we need to use popular books as sources. The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians. Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time. We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons. We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848. Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government. We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false. The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable. Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian. Wheen and Muravchick are neoconservatives writing outside the academic mainstream. We just do not know what Marx did with the 6,000 francs he received.",

I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand.

Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was \"\"betrayed\"\" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy. 19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC) \"",

(I should really have done that beforehand sorry to distort the picture.) On a somewhat related note (this is something I wanted to tell you and never got a chance to), I will suggest that \"\"White\"\" should really only be used as a substitute for a player's name (like our policy says) and never as a substitute for \"\"the white pieces\"\" that latter usage (which crops up in phrases like \"\"Alekhine had White\"\" or \"\"played White\"\") is not documented in any dictionary I checked, including the OED; it should probably be treated as a colloquialism.

Honestly, I think that if people write it as a \"\"single\"\", they don't really care if it isn't available separately; simply calling something a single doesn't specify whether it's promo or not. For people trying to cater to consumers, like Billboard.com reviews, if it's a popular hit and/or music video, people know it; it doesn't matter under what technical details it was released. But I think the difference is that since we are able to specify this, we probably should. We should try to reflect the reality. I don't think having a music video and a high placement in charts does anything to change the type of single it is; I've seen music videos for promo singles many times before; even some for album tracks. Isn't it a promo single nevertheless if it's only available separate from the album for promotional purposes? It's not like this is degrading the single in any way either; some artists just don't release subsequent album singles separately for consumers because they'd rather prefer they buy the album. \"",

I've recently discovered (perhaps rediscovered) that the article was possibly semiprotected and that my bold (as per WP:BOLD and perhaps contrary to WP:CYCLE) act of trying to rename it might require some form of consensus on that step. I could take the liberty and not agree with you that I have given a proposal at all, exactly because of my act (without any prior discussion about it) given, and if so, I could conclude that then there was nothing to reject in the first place. Not to mention that the terms overwhelming or even majority are to the least inappropriate, if not even biased. I concur that the argument of temporal proximity of discussions and renamings could be regarded as an arguments for not to rename again, but I think it doesn't suffice. Thank you for the link provided, I cherish the gesture a lot. I could again be free and express my disagreement with your opinion that I have to perform the rename via WP:RM, for I could consider that there is no obligatory procedure to be taken for such an act of renaming. Why, WP:RM is merely a guideline, if it is at all - nothing is stated at the page. Perhaps a project is the right name to select for WP:RM, as it is implied on the page itself. Since, the term project inherently has no attributes of obligation - if not even posesses a certain quality of casualness - I might considered the term has quite different characteristics. But, I honestly appreciate you informing me on this issue. All the best, 's talk \"",

An alternative cause of the epidemic is the opposite: too much vitamin D supplementation and fortification among the very young, which makes a lot of sense considering the calcium channel nature of many autism syndromes, the biochemistry of those with autism, and the epidemic. I have a book about it on amazon and some academics have told me the ideas in it are provacative. Does something need significant media exposure before it can appear in wikipedia?

If you have any further comments, raise it on the talk page. This is not a matter of ownership, it's just that these petty format issues (whether it be dates, centuries spelled or numbered, etc.) are aggravating and unnecessary, and it's audacity to insist upon it when your claims for it are baseless.

You won't have the pain anymore. Everyone else? Don't worry, they'll get by. What do you mean It's not your fault things turned out badly? It certainly IS your fault. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for what you've done - and failed to do. Maybe things could have changed if you weren't such a weakling. You're defective. You've been that way for a long time. You are proof that God makes mistakes. Look at your life. Failure after failure after failure. And should we mention those \"\"things\"\" that you did? You know what I'm talking about. I can't believe you did that! You disgust me. You should have died a long time ago. You know I'm right. JUST DO IT!!!\"",

In sort tough: During the flag/CoA merges, with CoA articles it was the WS article that was merged into the SADR one, as the SADR article contained nearly all the significant edit history. It was given a WS title via a Technical move request. Someone (not going to unnecessarily publicize his name) has been trying to unilaterally re-split the articles, even tough he's the only one who thinks that should be done and everyone else who has an opinion thinks that there should be one article. He had the Technical move of the merged article undone, on the procedural baces that he objected to it, as a prelude to atemping to unilaterally split the article against conciseness. His split was undone by Dzlinker and myself, hence the poor title which doesn't match the scope. If on the other hand you think the article gives the Moroccan regional CoA's too much WP:WEIGHT or somthing, that's another matter, and you could discuss it at the NPOV Noticeboard, or maybe the article talk page.",

If I'm counting correctly, this IP has been blocked 26 times before (after eliminating the temporary unblocks and reblocks). I gather from your temporary unblocks that you sometimes edit from this IP. Given the pattern of vandalism and the recurrence despite repeated warnings, I have put an extended block on this IP. I believe that I have put the block on using the new \"\"anon-only\"\" feature so hopefully it will have no impact on you or other signed in users.

However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them. If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date. The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as \"\"a homemade clock\"\" or \"\"an invention\"\". The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went \"\"viral\"\", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media. Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock. \"",

So, once again, THERE ARE NOT 98% GREEKS IN GREECE SO STOP THE CRAP. I have tired of putting links to official reports when idiots here remove them. Just grow up and learn how to make correct arguments, instead of the childish GREEKS ARE WONDERFUL AND CLEVER mentality.",

After verifying the truth of the offer, Honey Singh is said to have set aside all his other commitments and rushed to Mumbai to meet Bhardwaj. At first when Honey Singh was contacted by Vishal Bhardwaj over telephone he considered it to be a prank call.[1] His belief consolidate when he was asked to rap on verses written by Gulzar.[1] After verifying the entire incident he set aside all his prior commitments and travelled to Mumbai to meet Bhardwaj at the earliest I'm not sure if a full-blown CCI is called for, though. I generally look for 5 examples of outstanding copyright issues to make sure it's worth asking for community resources. It can take hours for me to review fully - especially where close paraphrasing is the issue instead of copy-pasting. (Copy-pasting - so much easier!) I jumped heavily through his history and didn't find a lot of problematic content that seems to cross the line into copyright issues. What I did find seems to be gone. Mind you, this is a judgment call and I'm not 100% sure I'm suggesting the right one. Without actually DOING the CCI, I can't be sure I'm not missing something major. (talk) \"",

Per Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context#Dates stand alone years should not be linked. There are several instances of linked years in this article. Also per Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context words should only be linked if they provide appropriate context for the article. An example of this problem happens in the Economy section where common words such as aircraft, coffee and automobiles are linked. Per WP:DASH date ranges should not use hyphens but rather endashes. This seems to be a problem in citations. In the External links section there's no need to tag English sources as such; this is the English Wikipedia after all. Only tag sources in Portuguese. I have some more comments but no more time today. I'll get back on this tomorrow. Good luck,",

Robinson was the main headquarters once the Remount Service really got organized (after World War I), but as Montanabw pointed out the majority of the actual stations were in the West. One thing the remount service is credited with (as it was only in operation on a large scale for about 20-25 years) was an overall improvement of the quality of horses in civilian service. This was because the Army didn't (and couldn't) buy all the animals produced by the program and the breeders were allowed to keep those that didn't meet standards or were otherwise unneeded.",

The reverted edits fromOnline Shopping and Electronic Commerce which cover the four central claims have those references you quote. The newspaper cuttings can be found in date order at Press Cuttings, Aldrich Archive, University of Brighton. There are no paqe numbers. In the Michael Aldrich article other references are also used. There are three central claims - he invented an online shopping system[he actually claims to have invented online shopping, which I left for peer review],Thomson Holidays 1981 was the first recorded B2B and Gateshead SIS/Tesco was the first B2C with the world's first recorded online shopper. For the first claim I found 4 sources in the Press Cuttings plus of course Aldrich's own claims. For the second there are also 4 sources, one peer reviewed. For the third, there is a peer reviewed source and a TV interview by Lawrence McGinty, an acclaimed UK science reporter, broadcast on Independent Television News in the UK in 1984. In looking at the sources common-sense is needed. Aldrich's teleshopping systems received a very sceptical welcome. HiFi systems were the big news in 1980. Many reports of his new system are wonderfully garbled and a little silly. Few understood what he was talking about. Online shopping did not exist.

Further more, here is link to an interview, where Tim Gaines says he is a Amateur Radio Operator, he gives his old call and when he moved, he changed it. If you go to QRZ.COM and click on the detail tab, you will see the history of his calls at the bottom. I know these things, because I am an amateur radio operator. I know these things, because I am also an Amateur Radio operator. My call is K8CPA and you can look me up as well. ) Many Thanks. -Chuck Adkins",

This leads to my final question, shouldnt then most Mexicans be classified white, according to the CIA? Finally, I have been to several parts in Mexico and I have noticed that many, or the majority of Mexicans in central Mexico look whiter than Italians, French and middle eastern, which are classified as white everywhere. A large percentage of the Argentinean population has Amerindian mixture, doesn't that make them Mestizo's? Any ways, we will never know for sure until a large genetic sample is taken.

We'll begin with the general radial equation as it applies to sphere A, Applied centripetal force + induced centrifugal force = m were r is the radius. Since the string joining the spheres is not changing in length, then m will be equal to zero and so the centrifugal force outwards on sphere A will be equal to the centripetal force inwards on sphere A, which is given by tension T. Hence T = mv^2/r which equals both the centrifugal force and the centripetal force. Every force acting on sphere A will have an equal and opposite force acting on sphere B. Hence the centripetal force (-T) acting on sphere B could be considered as a reactive centrifugal force from the perspective of sphere A. This example is OK, but because it is circular, it masks the general picture. If you were to choose an elliptical example, that would eliminate some of the equalities and also eliminate any confusion that might ensue from those equalities.

If that happens, we will have to find a source to add it again. talk \"",

I don't really see why the article should valorise so yet another oddball theory about Lucy, especially as the Bateson 'incest' one is so much more plausible and yet not referenced. But as I say it's years since I did any Wordsworth reading. Of course critics have always tended to agree the Lucy poems were influenced by the intensity of William and Dorothy's relationship.

I propose we adopt the following: Evolution: Umbrella term, any change over time, as stated in first sentence of article. Natural selection, horizontal gene transfer, etc... Mechanisms which explain evolution, the observation. Theories of evolution: A theory to explain one particular facet of evolution in terms of natural history (e.g. Out of Africa Theory, CretaceousPaleogene extinction event) The other problem with this article is that many scientists were motivated by a desire to explain why livings things are adapted to their environment or to explain the diversity of life.

The finished wording may be awkward, but it is only because I try to keep material that others contributed, rather than delete it. However, the original paragraph avoided mentioning that there are sources which show a long-standing tradition of comparison, and the strict definition of a virgin birth has been no hindrance to this tradition.

You can include it by putting the complete link (with http:// etc) into single brackets like this: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/example_diff], the result will then appear like this, or like this. Look at the markup, you'll figure out the rest. These diffs or differences are often used as proof of precisely which edit by another user you are talking about.

If you want to see the sources: Go look at the history of the page pre-vandalism. Go look at the history of the talk page pre-vandalism. Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30+ sources are extensively discussed and analyzed, and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of \"\"reliable\"\" which you have not familiarized yourself with. This debate has already been done and it's very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs; the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page. Without an \"\"admin in my pocket\"\" my claims fall on deaf ears; I understand this all too well. If you or your allies were interested in due process, you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated. Your kind will always demand that others do all the work even when it has been done in exhaustive detail.

I just wanted to thank you for being attentive and catching that blanking the letters, though, leaves us with a 0 byte article that won't show up as a red link. Normally, if someone creates an article full of gibberish like that (or crude/rude vandalism), it should have the following tag added to it: {{speedy}}. That tags the article for deletion so that an admin can come through and delete it from the database (as I did with retail bank). I just figured I'd let you know for next time, since you're already helping catch that kind of thing. -) Thanks again for keeping an eye out, and welcome to Wikipedia.

(Then again in 1938 the Cole Porter song My Heart Belongs to Daddy seems to make a subtle reference to cunnilingus (.. to dine on my fine finnan haddie .. asking for more .. etc) without any adverse results.) There is harsh irony in this since it appears that the opposite is the case, that Hickey's wife was totally faithful and endlessly forgiving of his womanizing and drinking sprees. This surfeit of virtue creates such self-hatred in Hickey and anger at his wife that he is ultimately driven to kill her to end their common pipe dream that each of his indiscretions will be the last. \"",

How do we find reliable sources that makes this kind of distinction?

But, at the same time I think it's equally fair to say \"\"can you provide a number of sources that says the two terms are the same?\"\". I think as PBS is suggesting a change from the historical norm, the onus of proof is on him. One final point (apologies for overly long posts); PBS keep in mind that there are undoubtly \"\"legal\"\" definitions for both these terms, but there are also definitions that exist in the public phsyci.

The use of the term Empire of the Greeks (Latin: Imperium Graecorum) to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire also implied that in the West it was no longer seen as the Roman Empire. The authority of the Byzantine Emperor as successor of Roman Emperors, was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in his struggle against his enemies in Rome, Leo used the lack of a male occupant of the throne of the Eastern Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself. Whenever the Popes or the rulers of the West made use of the name Roman to refer to the eastern Roman Emperors, they preferred the term Imperator Romani instead of Imperator Romanorum, a title that Westerners maintained applied only to Charlemagne and his successors.\"\" I'd leave the last sentence though since it demonstrates that there was still a certain ambiguity about how Popes and other western rules saw the Byzantine Empire. \"",

Given that, is it really a nemonic? A second thing I want to do is give for consideration the nemonic I learned way back when we used paper trig tables. Sorry, I do not know a reference for it. And I can not edit it in, because I don't know the markup here on Wiki. It is: OH, AH, Oh-Ah, Ah-Oh, HA, HO (Say it moderately fast). Sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, cosecant are: O/H, A/H, Oh/Ah, Ah/Oh, H/A, H/O. Unlike the soa-cah-toa nemonic it gives all six common functions. But I like to teach only the 1st three, OH, AH, Oh-Ah (simple enough), or even only the first two, OH AH and have them (students) memorize only Sin, Cos, and Tan then have them learn and understand that tan= sin/cos and the last three are inverses of the 1st three. It might sound a bit like a tongue twister at first, but it only took a my high school trig class about 15 minutes to learn it and a good part of that time was laughter and it is silly enough to be memorable.
